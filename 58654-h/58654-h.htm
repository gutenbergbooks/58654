<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The circumstances that have led to the production of
this little book are, I think, sufficiently explained in the introductory
chapter; there is, therefore, no need to dwell upon
them here. It is only necessary perhaps to warn the reader
that he will find in what follows but little that is original.
With the exception of small contributions and suggestions upon
special points, in the last few chapters alone does there exist
anything that has not already found a place in the literature
dealing with the subject; and probably it will be the earlier
rather than the later portions of the book that will most often
be consulted. Nevertheless, a work of compilation, such as the
present for the most part aims at being, may have its justification
and a certain sphere of usefulness; especially so perhaps in the
present case, since a certain proportion of the original papers
to which reference is here made is contained in books and
periodicals that have at no time been readily accessible to the
English-speaking public and were for some years practically
unobtainable.</p>

<p>The reader may possibly experience some surprise and
disappointment at finding that, while the relations between
parents and children and between brothers and sisters come
in for much attention, those between husband and wife (which
will probably be regarded as equally fundamental to any consideration
of the psychology of the family) are but lightly touched
upon. That this is the case is merely a consequence of the
lines along which psycho-analytic knowledge has for the most
part advanced. It is perhaps less to be regretted than would
at first appear: for in the first place, the amount of consideration
given to the marriage relationship has been fairly generous
during recent years, while the relations between parents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
children and among the junior members of the same family,
have been relatively neglected: in the second place, the study
of the two last named, chronologically earlier, relationships (and
especially the filio-parental one) is&mdash;as will be seen&mdash;capable
of throwing considerable light upon the subsequent marital
relationship; it would seem probable indeed that a thorough
understanding of the problems of love, sex, and marriage cannot
be attained without a preliminary knowledge of the nature of
the psychic bonds that unite parent and child&mdash;a knowledge
that psychology is only now beginning to afford.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I feel a very genuine regret that I
have been unable to include some discussion of the problems
connected with the <em>size</em> of families. These problems are, I am
convinced, of the greatest importance. At a moment like the
present when large portions of the human race are suffering
from a shortage of the very necessities of existence the question
of family limitation, in particular, becomes one that is of enormous,
one might almost say of paramount, urgency. Nevertheless, the
treatment of this question from the psychological, as distinct
from the ethical, sociological or economic standpoint, has as
yet been so slight and fragmentary, as to make a full consideration
of the question scarcely suitable to a volume of expository
character; and I have thought it better to omit the subject almost
altogether than to deal with it in a manner that would be
either inadequate and superficial or else manifestly inappropriate<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.</p>

<p>I am of course aware that much with which we have here
to deal makes far from pleasant reading. The unpleasantness
arises mainly from the fact that, in the pursuit of our present
purpose, we are chiefly brought into contact with the unconscious
and more primitive aspects of the mind rather than
with the more recently acquired and more morally edifying
aspects. But those who realise the importance, for human
welfare and progress, of a true understanding of our mental
nature, should no more be deterred from the consideration of
unpleasant aspects of the mind, than should the student of
economics neglect to take account of poverty or the student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
of hygiene turn away from the contemplation of disease. From
personal observation and experience, as well as from more
theoretical considerations, I have acquired a deep conviction
of the significance of those aspects of the human mind with
which we are here concerned. It is principally because I am
assured that a wider realisation and a deeper study of these
aspects&mdash;both by the student of the mind and by the ordinary
reading public&mdash;will contribute in very considerable measure
to the solution of many of the most important moral and social
problems with which humanity is faced, that I have ventured
to embark upon the following, I fear very inadequate, presentation
of our knowledge on the subject.</p>

<p>It only remains for me to express my sincere thanks to
those who have assisted me in one way or another; particularly
to Dr. Ernest Jones who was the first to interest me in the
work of Freud and his followers, and without whose personal
help in more than one direction, the present pages could not
have been written. I am also deeply indebted to Mr. Cyril
Burt for many valuable criticisms and suggestions, to Mr.
Edward de Maries for several interesting comments on the
subject matter of the last few chapters, to Mr. Eric Hiller for
assistance in seeing the work through the press, and to my
wife for help in a variety of ways throughout the work.<br />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a><span class="small80">CHAPTER I</span><br />
<br />
INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p>There is now some very general measure of agreement
<span class="sidenote">The needs of
social reconstruction</span>
that if humanity is to escape the fate of having passed through
the ordeal of world-wide war in vain, the recent era of
destruction must be followed by a period of reconstruction
and reorganisation, in which many of our systems, institutions,
customs and beliefs must be tested, and where necessary
refashioned, in the light of our changed ideals and points of
view and of the widened experience of human needs and
possibilities which our existence through these years of conflict
has brought us.</p>

<p>The degree of success attained by any such attempt at
<span class="sidenote">Science and
reconstruction</span>
readjustment on a large scale to changed standards and
conditions, must to a very considerable extent depend upon
the advance that is achieved by, and the application that is
made of, the various branches of science dealing with the
phenomena of human life in all its aspects. Biology, physiology,
medicine, hygiene, economics, politics, law and education must
all contribute their share to the solution of the great problem
of reconstituting human society upon a satisfactory peace
footing. Above all perhaps, it is to the science of the human
mind that we should most naturally turn for enlightenment
in dealing with many of the most important aspects of this
problem.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it so happens that Psychology is among the
<span class="sidenote">The present
status of
Psychology</span>
youngest of the sciences; its state of development, in comparison
with that of many other disciplines, is as yet in no wise
commensurate with the relative importance for human welfare
of the problems with which it is concerned. Conscious of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
disproportion between our present knowledge and the weight
of the matters that are at stake in any application of psychological
theory to practical affairs, many leading psychologists
have preferred to postpone any attempt at such application
until the more important results of recent research, many of
which are still matter for controversy, shall have been firmly
established upon a wider and more unassailable foundation.</p>

<p>Perhaps as a consequence of this attitude (praiseworthy no
doubt in itself), and of its effects&mdash;direct and indirect&mdash;upon
psychological outlook and procedure, there exists at the present
time a fairly widespread notion that Psychology is largely a
matter of empty speculations or trivial technicalities, "a happy
refuge for the lazy industry of pedants<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>," as a well known
author has recently called it, with little or no bearing upon the
larger problems of human life and conduct. It would appear,
however, that the war&mdash;with its urgent call for immediate
practical action&mdash;may have proved the means of inducing
<span class="sidenote">The application
of Psychology
to practical
problems</span>
psychologists to adopt a less academic attitude in the pursuit
of their science; of compelling them to carry out a stocktaking
of the results already achieved with a view to ascertaining
which, if any, are of a nature to throw light upon the actual
problems of the time, and to work out in detail the application
of psychological principles to these problems in all cases where
such application promises to be of importance. Thus, immediately
following upon the entrance of the United States into the war,
the psychological resources of that country were mobilised by
the American Psychological Association with a view to the
immediate investigation of urgent questions affecting the conduct
of the war. Under a central committee there were constituted
no less than twelve subcommittees, each in charge of a special
field and each acting under the chairmanship of a psychologist
of special eminence in that field. Previous to this there had
already been formed in this country a War Research Committee
of the Psychological Subsection of the British Association to deal
with problems of practical and theoretical importance connected
with, or arising out of, the war. Assistance on a considerable
scale in a variety of matters of direct military importance has
also been rendered by several of the psychological laboratories
attached to the Universities of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>It is perhaps, however, more especially on the medical
side that the question of the utilisation of psychological knowledge
<span class="sidenote">Medical
Applications of
Psychology</span>
for practical purposes has been brought into prominence by the
war. The very large number of soldiers and civilians suffering
from war-shock in its various forms has emphasised the need
for psychological treatment of the functional nervous disorders;
and has drawn further attention to the various methods of
treatment by suggestion, re-education, psycho-analysis and other
psycho-therapeutic measures, which even before the war were
beginning to attract widespread interest. The work that had
been done by these methods before the war had indicated that
there existed a very considerable prevalence of nervous troubles
even among those who were apparently subjected to no
abnormally high degree of mental strain. The examination of
many cases of war neuroses has shown that there is little if
any qualitative difference between the case of those who break
down under the abnormal pressure of war conditions and the
<span class="sidenote">War-shock</span>
case of those who are unable to stand even the relatively mild
stresses and difficulties incidental to a time of peace. All persons
are, it would appear, liable to suffer nervous breakdown if
subjected to emotional strain beyond a certain limit; this limit
varying, however, very considerably from one individual to
another. Modern war increases to some degree the strain to be
borne by almost everyone, the increase being very great in the
case of those actually engaged in fighting; as a consequence
the limit is passed, and some form of nervous disability or
breakdown occurs in a large number of persons who would
have remained unaffected during peace.</p>

<p>The amount of strain that can be actually borne with impunity
by any individual is no doubt dependent upon a considerable
<span class="sidenote">Psychic
integration</span>
number of complex conditions. Recent research has shown that
among the <em>psychological</em> conditions one of quite special importance
is constituted by the general state of integration of the motive
forces of the mind. A person whose instincts and impulses are
co-ordinated sufficiently to maintain, as regards all the leading
aspects of life, a relatively harmonious functioning of the whole
personality, can preserve mental health in circumstances under
which a less integrated mind would fail, owing to the waste of
energy occasioned by the internal struggles of the conflicting
tendencies and emotions aroused in situations of difficulty or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Importance of
correct mental
development</span>
danger. The attainment of the desirable degree of mental
integration is itself very largely dependent upon a process of
successful mental growth and development, in the course of which
the conflicting tendencies and motives (of which the mind is so
largely made up) so modify and mould each other as to permit
of the proper discharge of psychical energy along all suitable
channels without undue friction or inhibition. Great importance
attaches, therefore, from the point of view of mental efficiency
and stability in adult life, to the influences which control the
development of the conative trends during childhood and
adolescence.</p>

<p>It is to the consideration of one of the most potent of these
<span class="sidenote">Family
influences</span>
influences that the present pages are devoted. Even on a
superficial view it is fairly obvious that, under existing social
conditions the psychological atmosphere of the home life with the
complex emotions and sentiments aroused by, and dependent on,
the various family relationships must exercise a very considerable
effect on human character and development. Recent advances
in the study of human conduct indicate that this effect is even
greater than has been generally supposed: it would seem that,
in adopting his attitude towards the members of his family
circle, a child is at the same time determining to a large extent
some of the principal aspects of his relations to his fellow men
in general; and that an individual's outlook and point of view
in dealing with many of the most important questions of human
existence can be expressed in terms of the position he has
taken up with regard to the problems and difficulties arising
within the relatively narrow world of the family.</p>

<p>Besides showing the importance for mental development of
<span class="sidenote">their
importance,
difficulty, and
complexity</span>
the problems connected with family life, modern psychological
research has also revealed something of the nature of these
problems. It is true that of the results obtained in this field
there are as yet few, if any, which can be regarded as definitely
settled; many, no doubt, will, in the light of future work, be
seen to require more or less extensive revision, qualification
or addition; some perhaps may have to be rejected altogether.
Nevertheless it would appear that, as a consequence of the
work already done, certain main principles at least have emerged
so clearly as to justify, if not indeed to demand, the serious
attention of all those who, at this critical period of human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
history, have to deal directly or indirectly with questions
affecting family life in one or more of its numerous aspects.
The sociologist, the moralist, the spiritual adviser, the teacher,
the family physician and the parent are all intimately concerned
with such questions; and it is primarily with the needs of such
as these in view that the present brief exposition of the subject
has been undertaken. After what has been already said, it is
perhaps unnecessary to offer any further warning against
accepting all the results of psychological investigation which are
here set forth as claiming equal validity or as being equally
capable of generalisation or application on a large scale. No
dogmatic enunciation of facts or principles is here attempted or
desired, even where, owing to the endeavour to avoid entering
upon the discussion of matters too intricate or controversial
to fall within the scope of our present treatment, the
statements may possibly appear somewhat dogmatic in form.
Our aim is rather to produce a more widespread realisation of
the immense and far-reaching significance of the psychological
problems connected with family life; to indicate some of the
ways in which psychological knowledge has thrown light upon
the solutions of these problems; and perhaps, by these means,
to be of some assistance to that very large class of persons
who, at one time or another during their lives, find themselves
compelled to deal with such problems&mdash;whether as entering
into their own lives, as affecting others for whom they are
responsible, or as forming part of larger questions, social,
religious, medical or pedagogic, in which they have an interest.
To those who have once realised the complexity, the obscurity,
and above all the tremendous intensity of the psychic factors
entering into these problems, there can be little doubt that in
so far as Psychology is able to afford some reasonably sure
guidance as to their solution, it will have achieved one of the
most successful and valuable of all applications of science to
social and ethical phenomena. The time for such application
on a large scale has not yet come. But the progress that has
been already made would seem to indicate that the expectation
of some very real assistance in these matters from the science
of Psychology is no longer hopeless.</p>

THE PRIMITIVE EMOTIONS IN RELATION TO THE
FAMILY</h2>


<p>The progress that has recently been made in our understanding
<span class="sidenote">Psycho-analysis
and the
study of the
Unconscious</span>
of the importance and nature of the psychological
problems connected with family life is to a very considerable
extent due to the work of a single school of psychologists&mdash;the
so-called psycho-analytic school, which owes its origin to
Prof. Sigmund Freud of Vienna. The success that has attended
the efforts of this school has arisen principally from the fact
that the psycho-analysts have not confined their researches to
the conscious contents of the mind directly discoverable by
introspection, but have sought also to investigate the subconscious
or unconscious factors which enter into human conduct and
mentation<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>To assume the existence of unconscious mental processes
has seemed to some to involve an open contradiction in terms;
but at the present day there are few if any psychologists who
think that a satisfactory science of the mind can be erected on
the basis of the study of consciousness only. Even before
Psychology had definitely <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'aquired'">acquired</ins> the status of an independent
science, thinkers like Leibnitz, Schopenhauer, Fechner, Helmholtz,
Hartmann, Nietzsche, had realised that a complete account of
the nature and origin of the phenomena of consciousness
required the postulation of some force outside consciousness,
or at any rate outside the main stream of consciousness, which
yet appeared to react upon and co-operate with consciousness,
and which could be interpreted and understood in terms of
conscious process.</p>

<p>This result of more or less <em>a priori</em> speculation subsequently
received striking <em>a posteriori</em> confirmation from the work of a
large number of those engaged in different branches of psychological
investigation; including psycho-pathologists like Charcot,
Janet, Morton Prince, students of Psychical Research like
F. W. H. Myers, Gurney, Hodgson and experimental psychologists
like Müller and Schumann, Knight-Dunlap and Ach.
The extensive data contributed from these sources seemed to
afford convincing proof that processes such as we are ordinarily
inclined to regard as being invariably accompanied by
consciousness, can occur, at any rate under certain circumstances,
without the knowledge or conscious co-operation of the person
by whom they are accomplished. The penetrating insight, the
fearless logical consistency, combined with the exceptional
ability of detecting widespread but hidden identities and
similarities which have distinguished the work of Freud enabled
him to show that, far from being operative only under certain
special or rare conditions, the unconscious mental forces of the
human mind are continually active during waking life and even
during sleep, and exercise a profound influence on the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
course of consciousness and conduct. As the result of the far
reaching investigations of Freud and of his followers, it would
seem indeed that we shall probably have to look to the
Unconscious for an understanding of the ultimate nature of all
the deepest and most powerful motive forces of the mind.</p>

<p>As is now well known, the psycho-analytic method originated
<span class="sidenote">Psycho-analysis
applied to
the study of
the family</span>
as a method for the study and treatment of hysteria and other
functional nervous disorders, which were found to depend upon
the influence of unconscious mental factors. The discovery of
the importance of the feelings and tendencies connected with
family life, especially as affecting these unconscious factors,
dates from this time of the earliest use and application of
Psycho-Analysis. As in the case of so many other problems
upon which the method has cast light, Freud himself was the
first to show something of the intimate nature of the influence
exerted by the family relationships. Certain aspects of the
subject were already revealed in the Papers on Hysteria, published
conjointly with Breuer in 1895&mdash;a work which indicated for the
first time something of the importance and nature of the
subsequently developed psycho-analytic method.</p>

<p>Here and in the other early works of Freud there gradually
emerge the fundamental conceptions which distinguish the
<span class="sidenote">The child's
love to its
parents</span>
psycho-analytic school<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>. Among these conceptions is that regarding
the very important part played in the moral and emotional
development of the child by the psychological factors which
connect the child with its parent, and more especially by the
child's feelings of love towards its parent. This love is shown
to be of exceptional importance for a variety of reasons. In
the first place it constitutes as a rule the earliest manifestation
of altruistic sentiment exhibited by the child, the first direction
outwards upon an object of the external world of impulses
and emotions which have hitherto been enlisted solely in the
service of the child's own immediate needs and gratifications.
As such it constitutes in the second place the germ out of
which all later affections spring, and by which the course and
nature of these later affections are to a large extent moulded
and determined. Further (and this is perhaps the most significant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as it is certainly the most startling of Freud's discoveries in
this field) there is shown to be no clear cut difference between
the nature of this early filio-parental affection and that of the
later loves of adolescent and adult life. The sexual aspect,
which imparts the characteristic and peculiar quality to the
most powerful affections of maturity, is found to be present
also, in a rudimentary form, in the loves of childhood and of
infancy and to exert an important influence upon the earliest
of all attachments&mdash;that of the child towards its parents. These
strong emotional forces concerned in the love of children to
parents&mdash;and particularly the sexual or quasi-sexual elements
of these forces&mdash;were found, moreover, not only to be of the
greatest importance for the normal emotional development of
the individual, but also to play a leading part among the
factors determining the causation and nature of the neuroses.</p>

<p>In this last conception regarding the continuity of the
young child's love of its parents with the sexual emotions of
later life we are brought face to face with one of the most
striking and characteristic features of Freud's work. The mere
idea of such incestuous or quasi-incestuous feelings and
tendencies as are here indicated provokes astonishment, repugnance
and incredulity. The arousal of an attitude antagonistic
to the reception of such views&mdash;even though such an attitude
be inevitable and invariable&mdash;must not however, be regarded
as constituting in itself a disproof of the existence of the
feelings and tendencies in question. Such an attitude is, on the
contrary, only what is to be expected if Freud's theory of the
matter be correct. According to Freud's general conception of
mental development tendencies which&mdash;like these&mdash;are more or
less openly irreconcilable with prevalent moral sentiments and
traditions, become in the course of time (as we shall see more
fully later) opposed by other powerful forces of the mind; which
dispute with them the right of expression in thought or deed
and which eventually tend to refuse them admission to
consciousness at all. This action of opposing forces with regard
to the more primitive aspects of the mind is termed Repression
<span class="sidenote">Repression</span>
and so far as it manifests itself in consciousness finds its most
usual expression in the emotions of disgust, anger and fear.
As a result of this repression (which is of course only a
particular instance of the more general process already well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
known to psychologists and neurologists under the name of
Inhibition), the sexual aspects of the child's love towards its
parents (together with many other tendencies which conflict
similarly with the notions of propriety developed as the child
grows up) are, to a greater or less extent, thrust out of
consciousness into the unconscious regions of the mind, there
to drag out a prolonged existence in a comparatively crude
and undeveloped form, and to manifest themselves in consciousness
and in behaviour only in an indirect, symbolic or distorted
manner. The very fact that, when brought into consciousness,
such ideas are often greeted with exaggerated antipathy or
incredulity, constitutes therefore, if anything, a confirmation of
the real existence of these ideas in the Unconscious; the feelings
of repulsion and disgust to which their introduction into
consciousness gives rise being but a manifestation of the
motive forces of Repression to which the original expulsion
from consciousness of the repugnant thoughts and tendencies
was due.</p>

<p>As the result of further study with gradually improving
<span class="sidenote">Dreams</span>
technique, Freud, in his later works, confirmed, elaborated
and extended his observations on the influence of the
family relationships in the growth and development of the
individual mind. Of particular importance, both in itself and
because of the general influence of the book as in some
respects the most thoroughgoing presentation of Freud's
methods and point of view, is the treatment of the matter in
the "Interpretation of Dreams." Here Freud introduces the
subject in connection with that of the so-called typical dreams,
<em>i. e.</em> dreams which occur to a large number of persons and to
the same person on a number of separate occasions. Among
such dreams, some of fairly frequent occurrence are, as Freud
points out, concerned with the death of near and dear relatives
who are still living at the time at which the dream takes place<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>.
The consideration of such dreams leads Freud to maintain that
they are to be interpreted (in accordance with the general
principle of wish-fulfilment)<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> as the manifestation of an actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
desire in the Unconscious for the death of the person concerned.</p>

<p>In explanation of this astonishing and repellent conclusion,
<span class="sidenote">The hostile
element
in family
relationship</span>
Freud draws attention to the fact that the relations of the
members of a family to one another are in many respects of
such a nature as to call forth hostile emotions almost if not
quite as readily as they call forth love; that brothers and
sisters, parents and children, owing to the very closeness of
the mental and material ties which bind them together and to
the very considerable degree to which they are mutually dependent,
often find themselves in opposition to, or in competition
with, one another. The antagonisms thus produced are frequently
of such a kind as to meet with the same opposition from the
moral consciousness as is encountered in the case of the sexual
or quasi-sexual aspects of love between members of the same
family. In their more intense degrees, therefore, they too are
often subjected to a process of repression and become banished
to the Unconscious. They are, moreover, especially when so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
banished, very far from being incompatible with the existence
of a very genuine affection at the conscious level. In view of
the conflicting nature of the tendencies that may be thus
aroused, it is not surprising that as psycho-pathological research
has revealed, hatred towards near relatives may be of very
considerable importance also as a determining factor in the
production of neuroses. It has, in fact, been found that a repressed
hatred may underlie a whole series of pathological
symptoms in precisely the same manner as a repressed love.</p>

<p>The love aspect of the family relationships itself however
<span class="sidenote">The correlations
of love
and hate</span>
often plays a part in dreams, both in a distorted and symbolic
representation and, more openly expressed, in a directly
incestuous form. In fact very frequently both love and hate
aspects may be combined in a dream or in a series of dreams
or set of pathological symptoms. In such cases love for one
member of the family is usually accompanied by jealousy or
hatred towards some other member who possesses or is thought
to possess the affections of the first. In its most typical form
this conjunction of love and hate aspects occurs in the attitude
of the child towards its parents. Here the dawning heterosexual
inclinations of the child (which, as Freud, and other
students of the mind, have shown, begin to manifest themselves
at a much earlier age than is often supposed, though full
heterosexual maturity is not attained, if ever, until after puberty)
usually bring it about that the love is directed towards the
parent of the opposite sex and the hate towards the parent of
the same sex as that of the child.</p>

<p>The feelings and tendencies in question have found expression
<span class="sidenote">The Œdipus
Complex</span>
in innumerable stories, myths and legends, in various
degrees of openness or of disguise, and with sometimes the
love and sometimes the hate elements predominating. It is
more especially in the myth of Œdipus, who unwittingly
becomes the murderer of his father and the husband of his
mother, that the ultimate nature of these tendencies is most
openly and powerfully revealed; and it is for this reason that
the combination of love and hate aspects with all the feelings
and desires to which they give rise has come to be shortly
designated as the Œdipus complex<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Tendencies, which, like those revealed in the Œdipus myth
and its numberless variations, have continued to manifest
themselves in the productions of the popular and the artistic
mind for many generations, would seem to show by their
universality and tenacity that their origins lie deeply embedded
in the very foundations of human life and character; and this
view of their importance is corroborated by the very significant
place which they are found to occupy as etiological factors in
the production of neuroses. Freud has gone so far as to say
that the tendencies centering round the Œdipus situation
form the "nuclear complex of the neuroses," <em>i. e.</em> the fundamental
point of conflict in the mind of the neurotic, about which the
other conflicts gather and upon which they are to a great
extent dependent. In the light of Freud's fruitful conception of
the neuroses as due largely to the fact that a part of the
emotional energy has suffered an arrest at, or a "regression"
to, a relatively early stage of mental development, this fundamental
rôle of the Œdipus complex in the neuroses would
seem to indicate that the proper development and control of
the child's psychic relations to his parents constitutes at once
one of the most important and one of the most difficult features
of individual mental growth. That this is in fact the case has
been shown both by the researches of Freud himself and by
those of all other psycho-analytic investigators, and may without
difficulty be confirmed from the experience of ordinary life by
those whose eyes have once been opened to the full significance
and innumerable manifestations of the psychic relationship
between parents and children.</p>

<p>In the light of these researches and observations the
<span class="sidenote">The normal
course of
development
of the child's
affections</span>
normal course of development of the child's affections, so far
as they concern us here<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, would seem to be somewhat as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
follows<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>: In the earliest period of its existence those tendencies
which are afterwards to develop into love, affection and desire for
persons or objects in the outer world are at first connected
with sensations from various parts of the child's own body.
<span class="sidenote">Auto-erotism</span>
This constitutes the auto-erotic stage in which the child is for
the most part concerned with outer things as objects of desire
merely in so far as they serve to bring about his own bodily
comfort and satisfaction. To begin with there is indeed in all
probability no clear distinction between the self and the
environment or between the animate or inanimate objects of
the environment. Corresponding to the gradual development of
<span class="sidenote">Object love</span>
these distinctions there is found the beginning of what is
called by Freud "object love", the experience of desire for,
and affection towards, some object or person of the environment,
the highest manifestation of which is found in the passionate
and all absorbing loves of subsequent adolescent or adult life.
This beginning of object love is a most important stage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
development, since on its success depends not only the possibility
of a normal growth of the sexual trends to full maturity, but
also, to a great extent, the occasion and opportunity for the
unfolding of many of the higher altruistic tendencies and
motives.</p>

<p>It is natural that, in the gradual transition from auto-erotism
to object love, the first object of the child's affection
should be chosen from amongst those who administer to its
bodily needs and comfort. Thus it is probable that in the conditions
of normal family life, the mother or the nurse is, in
nearly all cases, the first person selected. It would appear,
however, that at a relatively very early age, the sex of the
child begins to exert an influence on the choice of the loved
object, so that (as we have already noted) we find after a time
a predominant tendency for selection of the parent of the
<span class="sidenote">Heterosexuality</span>
opposite sex as the object of affection. This perhaps takes
place to some extent in virtue of an already ripening tendency
to heterosexual selection in the child. But there can be little
doubt that in many cases another factor is to some extent
operative in bringing about this result, <em>i. e.</em> the tendency of
the child to appreciate and to return the manifestations of
affection that are shown towards it. Now the parents in virtue
of their developed heterosexual inclinations tend very frequently
to feel most attracted to those of their children who are of the
opposite sex to their own and thus (consciously or unconsciously)
to indulge in greater manifestations of affection towards such
children; this unequal distribution of affection being in turn
perceived and reciprocated by the children themselves.</p>

<p>This reciprocation on the part of the child of the heterosexual
preferences of the parents undoubtedly plays a very
large part in the development of normal heterosexuality: just
how large is this part compared with that played by the instinctive
heterosexual reactions of the child, it is difficult or
impossible to say in the present state of our knowledge, since
in any given case the two factors are apt to be very closely
interrelated. The question is of interest because the relative
influence of the two factors must, it would appear, largely
determine the extent to which the direction of a child's sexual
desires is dependent upon innate and upon environmental
causes respectively. Should the direction of a child's object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
love toward persons of one sex rather than toward those of
the other be largely determined by the manifestations of
affection that the child receives, it would seem that the sexual
inclinations of the parents must exert a great influence in the
formation of the sexual character of their children, <em>e. g.</em> that
marked heterosexuality in the parents would tend&mdash;through its
effects on parental preferences and quite apart from any hereditary
influences&mdash;to produce equally developed heterosexual inclinations
in the children, whereas homosexually disposed parents would
tend in a similar way to bring up homosexual children.</p>

<p>If on the other hand, the direction of a child's object love
depends chiefly upon innate instinctive factors, the sexual dispositions
of the parents will play a much less important rôle
in the mental history of the child and will be influential only
in so far as they are directly inherited. The progress of psychological
research, statistical and psycho-analytic&mdash;will, we may
hope, cast much light upon this problem in the near future.</p>

<p>Another interesting question relating to the direction of
<span class="sidenote">Homosexual
and
heterosexual
development
in girls</span>
object love towards the parents is connected with the fact
that, in the case of female children, the influences making
towards heterosexual choice of object would seem, under normal
conditions of upbringing, to be liable to conflict with the
tendency for the affections of the child to go out in the first
place towards those to whom the child is chiefly indebted for
the satisfaction of its more immediate bodily needs. Under
these circumstances it might perhaps be expected that it would
be usual for girls to pass through a stage of mother love before
transferring the greater part of their affection to their father.
There is much reason to think that the number of girls
retaining an unusual or pathological degree of mother love in
later years is greater than the number of boys retaining a
corresponding degree of father love; if this be the case, it may
perhaps be held to show that the mother is indeed the first
object of affection in both boys and girls and that some of the
latter retain marked traces of this stage of their development
throughout subsequent life. Additional evidence pointing in the
same direction seems to be forthcoming from a number of
pathological cases among adult women, the study of which has
revealed the existence of a persistent and intense attachment to
the mother; this attachment being of an infantile character and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
situated in a deeper and more inaccessible layer of the Unconscious
than the father love, which appeared to have been,
in the process of growth, as it were, superimposed upon the
earlier affection. If father love in girls should prove to be
normally built upon the remains of an earlier period of exclusive
mother love which is common to both girls and boys,
it is evident that in this respect the development of heterosexual
object love in girls is a rather more complex process
than it is in boys. This greater complexity of the process of
development may, as Freud himself has pointed out in a somewhat
different but not altogether unrelated connection<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>, become
the cause of a number of those failures of adjustment to the
conditions of adult life&mdash;sexual and general&mdash;that are found to
underlie the neuroses. The greater incidence of certain neurotic
disturbances among women as compared with men may perhaps
ultimately be due in part<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> to the greater complexity of the
original process by which the object love of the child comes to
be directed to the parent of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>With the firm establishment of object love towards the
<span class="sidenote">Jealousy</span>
parent of the opposite sex, the conditions are present for the
arousal of jealousy towards the parent of the same sex, since
this latter is soon found to possess claims upon the affection
and attention of the loved parent which are apt to conflict
with the similar claims of the child. Thus the young girl
begins to resent the affection and consideration which her
mother receives at the hands of her father and comes in time
to look upon her mother as in some sense a sexual rival who
competes with her father's love. In imagination she will allow
herself to occupy her mother's place and may even attempt
to put this fancy into practice, if opportunity should offer; as
in the case cited by Freud<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of the eight year old girl who
openly proclaimed herself as her mother's successor when her
mother was absent on occasion from the family table, or in
the still more striking case of the four year old child who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
said:&mdash;"Mother can just stay away now; then father will have
to marry me and I shall be his wife." Boys experience a similar
jealousy towards their father and often come to regard his
presence in the family as that of an intruder or interloper who
disturbs the otherwise peaceful and loving relations between
his mother and himself. This view of the father as intruder
is particularly liable to occur if (as so frequently happens) the
father is absent from the home for relatively long periods
during the working hours of the day or even for several days
or weeks on end<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>. Even in the cases where the father is not
frequently away from home, his continued presence is sooner
or later found to be irksome in the same way as is the mother's
in the case of girls, and the desire for his removal will gradually
begin to make itself felt, if not in consciousness, at least in the
unconscious levels of the mind.</p>

<p>The hate aspect of the Œdipus complex would thus seem
normally to arise in the first place as a consequence of the
love aspect, the affection felt by the child towards the parent
of the opposite sex bringing about a resentment at the
presence of the other parent; this latter parent being
looked upon as a competitor for the affections of the loved
parent and a disturber of the peace of the family circle.
But though in its origin the hate aspect is thus usually a
secondary phenomenon, it may under suitable conditions grow
to equal or even to excel in importance the love aspect from
which it in the first place arose. This is especially liable
to be the case when, in addition to the specific interference
with the love activities of the child, the parent in question
<span class="sidenote">Causes of
parent-hatred</span>
causes more general interference with the child's desires and
activities, by adopting a harsh, intolerant or inconsiderate
attitude towards the child in their everyday relations or as
regards matters in which the child's interests and ambitions
are more especially concerned. To the envy and jealousy felt
towards a competitor and rival there is then added the hatred
and desire for rebellion against a tyrant and oppressor; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the complex emotions thus aroused may engender a hostile
sentiment of such intensity as, in some cases, to constitute one
of the dominant traits of character, not only of childhood but
of the whole of adult life.</p>

<p>Only second in importance to the attitude of the child
<span class="sidenote">Hatred between
brothers
and sisters</span>
towards its parents are its relations to its brothers and sisters.
Under the conditions of normal family life, brothers and sisters
are, after the parents, the most important persons in the
environment of the young child, and it is but natural that
these persons should be among the earliest objects of the
developing love and hate emotions of the child. Whereas,
however, in the child's relations towards its parents, love would
seem to be the emotion that is usually first evoked, in its
dealings with the other junior members of the family, the
opposite emotion of hate is in most cases the primary reaction.
This fact can be easily explained as to a great extent a natural
consequence of the necessary conditions of family life. Brothers
and sisters possess claims upon the attention and affection of
the loved parent (especially when that parent is the mother)
which are apt to conflict seriously with one another and may
on occasion be felt by the respective claimants to be almost
if not quite as irksome and exorbitant as those of the other
parent, whose competition with the child in this respect we
have already noted. From this source there frequently arise
feelings of violent jealousy between brothers and sisters, and
the attitude of hostility thus evoked may be increased, or at
any rate prevented from disappearing, by the fact that children
of the same family have to share not only the affection of
their parents but, to some extent at least, their material
possessions and enjoyments also.</p>

<p>The works of psycho-analytic writers contain numerous
examples of such brother and sister hatreds in early years. As
a rule the younger child resents the advantages and privileges
of which it finds the older children already in possession; it
finds itself in many respects compelled to submit to the superior
size and strength and experience of the older children, whom
it is therefore inclined to regard as tyrants, the only refuge
from whose brutal power lies in appeal to the still higher adult
powers who control the destinies of the nursery. Older children,
on their part, are inclined to regard any new arrival in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
family circle as an intruder upon their own preserves and a
competitor for their own cherished rights, privileges and
possessions. Hence the announcement of such a new arrival is
in many cases greeted, in the first instance, with anything but
joy, and the wish is often expressed that the intruder should
depart again whence he came. Indeed it would seem probable
from some cases that not a little of the interest displayed by
children in the processes of conception, gestation and (more
especially) birth, is due to the fact that these processes are
intimately connected with the appearance of a new brother or
sister to disturb the peaceful monopoly of the family possessions
and affections which the elder children have hitherto enjoyed.
In other cases, again, the resentment felt towards the new
intruder may be so great that it may even find expression in
an actual attempt on the part of an older child to do away
with the younger one<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> should a convenient opportunity for this
present itself.</p>

<p>Although jealousy and hatred are thus apt to be the first
<span class="sidenote">Love between
brothers and
sisters</span>
emotional reactions of brothers and sisters towards one
another, there can be no doubt that a brother or sister
may from the beginning be an object of affection, the object
love of the child being directed towards its brother or sister
in much the same manner as towards its parent. This is much
more likely to happen in relation to an elder than in relation
to a younger member of the family and occurs most frequently
when there is a considerable difference in age between the
children concerned, so that interests and desires no longer
conflict and overlap to the same extent as they do in the case
of children of approximately equal age. The most favourable
conditions for the direction of a child's object love in this
manner are to be found in those large working-class families,
where an elder sister frequently takes over some of the attributes
of the mother as regards the younger children. In such a case
the feelings of the younger child (particularly if that child be a
boy) towards its elder sister are usually of an affectionate nature
from the very start.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a><span class="small80">CHAPTER III</span><br />
<br />
THE ORIGIN OF CONFLICT IN RELATION
TO THE FAMILY</h2>


<p>In the emotional and affective attitudes of the child towards
its parents and the other important persons in its environment,
so far as we have now traced them, the child's conduct is in
<span class="sidenote">The primitive
a-moral nature
of the child</span>
some respects more nearly allied to that of the fully developed
human being than is generally recognised or admitted. In the
depth and intensity of its love and hate, in its sexual or quasi-sexual
activities and in its distinctive attitude towards persons
of different sex, the child reveals characteristics which have
often hitherto been regarded as exclusive manifestations of the
adult or adolescent mind. In another very important respect,
however, the child's conduct and feeling differ markedly from
those of the adult. The emotional and affective reactions with
which we have been dealing exhibit a straight-forwardness and
simplicity which is not found in the more developed minds of
normal adult persons, and which is due to the fact that the
child's early conative tendencies are able, to a relatively large
extent, to work themselves out without any serious opposition,
hindrance or modification caused by the presence of other
conflicting tendencies within the mind. The child's mind is a
relatively dissociated one; incompatible thoughts, emotions, feelings
and desires may successively invade the seat of consciousness,
lead to their appropriate reactions and be but little modified or
checked by one another. For this reason the child is, during
the earliest part of its life, a relatively a-moral being, for
morality implies the possibility of two or more courses of
thought or action&mdash;a better and a worse&mdash;and the lack of
integration in the child's mind only permits of this possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to a very limited extent. Thus it comes about that the very
young child is able to indulge openly in the expression of
sexual or hostile tendencies in a manner which is impossible
in later life; for to the child the expression of these tendencies
does not yet possess the moral and affective meaning which it
is destined subsequently to acquire. In the earliest years of
life the manifestations of quasi-sexual love, even in an incestuous
direction, are at first only the natural expression of a desire,
which is gratified as a matter of course and without any hesitation
produced by a sense of the immorality of these manifestations.
Similarly, when the child seeks, by death or otherwise,
to bring about the permanent removal of a rival or competitor,
the ideas of death and murder are, as Freud points out<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>,
at first quite uncomplicated by the thoughts, feelings and sentiments
which later come to be associated with them; the infliction
of death&mdash;real or imaginary&mdash;is simply the most natural
way of dealing, at the earliest stages of emotional development,
with unwanted persons who interfere with the child's desires
and tendencies.</p>

<p>This open and unrestricted expression of primitive tendencies
<span class="sidenote">Modification
of conduct as
the result of
Conflict</span>
is, however, confined to a phase of relatively short
duration in the history of the child's mind, being generally
found only in the first few years of life. The crude love or
hate for mother or father, brother or sister, which we have so
far been considering, does not long persist in its original form;
the normal development of the mind requires that these primitive
emotional attitudes shall undergo grave and far reaching
modifications, the production of which constitutes an important
step towards the attainment of the adolescent or adult point
of view.</p>

<p>These modifications are the result of a conflict which takes
<span class="sidenote">The forces of
Repression</span>
place in the mind between the love and hate impulses in their
original form and certain tendencies of an antagonistic nature
which (as already indicated in the last chapter), make their
appearance after a certain time and threaten to inhibit the
cruder manifestations of the primitive impulses. These new
tendencies are themselves, in all probability, derived from more
than one source. Those which produce modification in the love
impulses of the child, may be regarded as constituting, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Sexual
inhibition</span>
doubt, only so many particular instances of that inhibition of
sexual and quasi-sexual activity which exercises such a large
influence in the formation of human character in general.</p>

<p>The precise history and nature of the motives that are at
work here are not as yet completely understood, and we shall
have occasion to consider the subject again at a later stage of
our present enquiry. There can be little doubt that one of the
factors concerned is to be found in the suggestive influence of
social pressure and tradition manifesting itself in the case of
the child, through the behaviour and expression of the adult
persons with whom it is brought into contact<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. In appreciating
and responding to these influences, the child is probably helped
<span class="sidenote">Herd Instinct</span>
by a special instinctive mechanism which tends to make it conform
to the behaviour, opinions and emotional atmosphere of
its human environment. A "herd instinct" of this kind is regarded
by some psychologists as constituting the moral force
operating as one of the opposing tendencies in all intra-psychical
conflicts such as that with which we are here concerned<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>. It is
indeed almost certainly a factor of very considerable importance
in this connection; the manner in which sexual restrictions
and inhibitions so markedly vary from one time, place or social
condition to another indicates that there is no deep rooted instinctive
tendency towards the suppression of any particular
manifestations of sexuality, but rather that the nature of the
modifications and restraints undergone by sexual activities is
determined for the most part by prevalent moral conventions
passively taken over by the individual from the society in which
he finds himself. Nevertheless, it would seem doubtful whether the
practically universal existence of some kind of sexual restriction
can be entirely accounted for in this way. For other reasons it
would appear probable that a tendency to some sort of quite
general inhibition of primitive sexual activities is part of the
original mental endowment of each human individual, even
though the particular manifestations of this inhibitory tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
are principally determined by suggestive influences from the
environment. To this point also we shall have occasion to
revert later on, when we shall be in a more favourable position
for forming an opinion with regard to it.</p>

<p>With reference to the moral tendencies which are operative
in producing modifications of the primitive hatreds of the child
there can be little doubt that here also herd instinct is in many
cases a factor of importance. At quite an early age, the child
begins to learn that it is "right" to love and obey its parents
and "wrong" to resist the dictates of the parental authority or
to quarrel with its brothers or sisters: and these precepts are
constantly inculcated with all the impressive suggestiveness
which social, educational and religious influences have at their
command. Of equal, if not greater, importance, however, is the
<span class="sidenote">Love, gratitude
and
admiration</span>
tendency of the child to feel affection towards those with whom
it lives in intimate relationship, to whom it is indebted for all
or most of its material possessions and enjoyments and whom
it in many cases admires and looks up to as the ideal of fully
grown humanity to which it may itself one day attain. The
natural growth and development of these feelings are, however,
it is true, helped and encouraged by the moral suggestions received
from outside, whereas these same outside influences tend
powerfully to inhibit the contrary feelings of hatred and
hostility.</p>

<p>After this brief consideration of the nature of the psychic
<span class="sidenote">The nature
and results of
Conflict</span>
forces which at a certain stage of development come to be
arrayed in opposition to the primitive manifestations of love
and hate as brought out by the circumstances of family life, we
turn now to contemplate the nature and outcome of the conflict
that takes place within the mind between the two sets of
antagonistic tendencies. Our knowledge concerning this and
other similar intra-psychical conflicts has during recent years
been very considerably increased by the work of Freud and
other psychologists of the psycho-analytic school. Generally it
may be said that the outcome of such a conflict varies
according to the relative success of one of the conflicting
tendencies over the other. If the two combatants are of
approximately equal strength, there may be a continuous
struggle between them of such a kind as to make itself clearly
felt in consciousness; the individual being then as a rule incapable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of vigorous action in gratification of either tendency.
In other cases the competing tendencies may alternately dominate
consciousness and conduct; so that the behaviour of the
individual becomes characterised by impulsiveness and want of
balance rather than by want of energy.</p>

<p>At the opposite extreme there are conflicts which end by
the complete exclusion of one tendency from any direct influence
on consciousness or on behaviour; the individual becoming
then normally quite unaware of the existence of any
such tendency within his mind. This exclusion from consciousness
or from any direct manifestation in behaviour does not,
however, of itself bring about a complete annihilation of the
tendency in question. It would seem, on the contrary, that such
a tendency may continue to exist for a long period (even for
a whole lifetime) in the unconscious regions of the mind, where
its presence may be demonstrated by the use of suitable
methods. Such an outcome of conflict, in which one tendency
is driven down to the Unconscious and confined there by the
other, is&mdash;as we have already stated&mdash;usually designated by the
term Repression.</p>

<p>The process of Repression is, however, rarely carried to
<span class="sidenote">Displacement
and
Sublimation</span>
such a degree as to render one of the conflicting tendencies
completely and permanently incapable of direct expression.
Most frequently all that is effected is a modification of such a
kind that in its new form the repressed tendency no longer
conflicts to the same extent as before with the repressing
tendency. This process of modification has received the name
of Displacement and consists essentially in the abandonment
on the part of the repressed tendency of its original end or
object in favour of a new one which meets with less resistance
from the opposing motives. When the new end or object is of
such a nature as to be culturally or ethically of appreciably
greater value than the original one, the modification undergone
by the tendency in question is often spoken of as Sublimation&mdash;a
term which thus comprehends all the "higher" and more
desirable cases of Displacement<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>In the conflict with which we are here concerned, those
motives of a relatively social or ethical character which we
have already considered in this chapter, act as the repressing
force; while the original primitive tendencies of love and hate,
with which we were concerned in the last chapter, suffer the
repression. As regards the degree to which the repression is
carried, it would appear that in a considerable number of
cases the more strongly tabooed among the socially and ethically
objectionable elements become forced out of consciousness
without producing any immediate conscious equivalents. This,
perhaps, is liable to take place more especially as regards
some of the more directly sexual aspects of the child's attitude
towards its parents. As Freud has pointed out<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> there occurs
at some time in the early period of childhood&mdash;perhaps most
usually at about the sixth year, a relatively latent sexual period,
during which all sexual manifestations are more or less in
abeyance. The existence of this period would seem to imply a
temporary general sexual repression, in which the erotic aspects
<span class="sidenote">Incest
Repression</span>
in the affection of the child to its parents suffer, together with
all other sexual elements. This initial period of repression seems
to play an important part in the production of a permanent
dissociation between the sexual desires and the feelings experienced
in relation to the parents, so that sexual emotion
and filial affection are thereafter seldom permitted to enter
consciousness together. Indeed it would appear that this general
repression of sexual activity is to some extent removed only in
so far as this dissociation has taken place; for on the
reappearance of a more vigorous sexuality at the close of the
latent period, the erotic tendencies would seem normally to
have undergone a process of displacement so that they are no
longer so intimately connected with the parent-love as on their
first appearance.</p>

<p>In all the more favourable cases of development, however,
<span class="sidenote">Displacement
as regards the
object of love</span>
it is probable that even from the first the conflict between the
primitive elements of love and hate and the newly unfolding
ethical tendencies results to a great extent in the displacement
and gradual sublimation of the former and not merely in their
repression or return to a latent state. The process of displacement
here takes the form of a dissociation of the more erotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
aspects of the child's affection from the loved parent&mdash;these
aspects being thus set free for bestowal upon other persons.
The choice of such fresh objects for the child's affection is
determined in accordance with what would appear to be a
general law governing the process of displacement, viz., that
the new end or object, to which the psychic energy is directed,
must have some associative connection with the old object
which has been abandoned. For this reason, it is very frequently
possible to trace some kind of resemblance between the loved
parent and the new object of affection; though this resemblance
may be of very various degrees or kinds. Thus, the new object
of affection may bear some resemblance to the parent in one
or more of the following points: physical appearance (either
general or as regards some special feature), mental characteristics,
circumstances of life (both these last again being either
general or special), age, name, past history, occupation or family
relationship. Sometimes, moreover, the resemblance may be of
an opposing or negative kind, the later object of love being
markedly different from, or contrasting with, the original object
in some one or more of these characters. In the case of a
succession of such loved objects, it is not unusual for the
resemblance to the original object of affection to become
gradually less pronounced, in accordance with a further general
characteristic of Displacement, in virtue of which the higher
sublimations (<em>i. e.</em>, those which imply ends very different from,
and of higher cultural value than, the original objects of desire)
are only attained slowly and through a number of intermediate
steps.</p>

<p>A first step of frequent occurrence and of great importance
<span class="sidenote">Parent
Substitutes</span>
in a large number of cases is the transference of erotic love
from the parent to some other member of the family, e. g.,
brother, sister or (usually at a somewhat later stage of
development) cousin. In the first two cases the new choice of
object has the additional advantage of tending to abolish the
hate or jealousy which, as we saw, is apt to characterise the
original attitude towards such members of the family: and this
in two ways:&mdash;(1) negatively, by removing the cause of the
jealousy, since, as the parent is now no longer the sole object
of affection, the rival claims of brothers and sisters upon the
attention of the parent are no longer felt to be objectionable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
(2) positively, by investing the brother or sister with the
attributes of lovableness formerly reserved for the parent.</p>

<p>In the same way, the diversion of the erotic tendencies
from the parent of the opposite sex removes the principal
cause of jealousy and hatred felt towards the parent of the
same sex, so that, in the absence of other causes of hostility,
this hatred&mdash;in itself, as we pointed out, originally in some
respects a secondary phenomenon&mdash;may give place to the
affection which, in their capacity of protectors and benefactors,
tends normally to be inspired in some degree by both parents
alike. But even in so far as the hate may be primary (due as
a rule to frequent thwarting of the child's desires and activities
or to bullying, nagging or generally unsympathetic behaviour
on the part of the parent in question), it tends to undergo a
considerable degree of repression or displacement on its own
account, so that after a time the child no longer experiences
in consciousness any violent aversion to its parent; such
aversion being either confined to the Unconscious or displaced
on to other objects in a manner which we shall study
later on.</p>

<p>The fact that the first choice of loved object other than
<span class="sidenote">The infantile
attitude in
early love</span>
the parent is associatively connected with the original object
of love, is shown not only in the nature of the objects selected
but also to some extent in the attitude of the child or adolescent
towards the objects of his love. In the loves of the young
towards persons of the opposite sex, there is usually a strong
element of reverence and admiration, a deep feeling of gratitude
for any favours that may be received, combined with a sense
of the lover's own unworthiness and inferiority; a total attitude
very similar to that not unreasonably adopted towards their
own parents, to whom they are indebted for the very necessities
of life throughout their childhood and to whom they naturally
feel themselves to be inferior in knowledge, experience and
moral worth. Thus in the early loves of the young boy, the
objects of his affection are apt to be regarded as queen-like
or semi-divine beings&mdash;models of beauty, virtue and wisdom&mdash;to
whose perfections they themselves (the lovers) can never
hope to attain and of whom they must remain for ever to
some extent unworthy. Similar elements constitute the most
important factors in that tendency to <em>Schwärmerei</em> which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
so frequently distinguishes the early attachments of young
girls<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>The adoption of this attitude by the young in their early
loves is of course often facilitated by the fact that the objects
selected are older than the youthful lovers themselves. But
this is not a necessary condition. Something of this attitude
may indeed persist throughout the love life of the individual,
since the exaggeration of the desirable qualities of the loved
person, which forms a normal feature of sexual (and probably
of all) love, easily brings with it a sense of the relative
inferiority of the lover's own self. In the loves of a more
mature age, however, this relatively childlike attitude towards
the object of love is usually replaced by one in which the
lover plays a more active, vigorous and self-reliant part, such
as is suitable to a person of fully developed capacity and
experience.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with this latter change there goes on a
<span class="sidenote">Emancipation
from infantile
love objects</span>
continuance of the process of liberation of the love impulse from
its original object. This would seem to take place by a further
use of the mechanisms of Repression and Displacement. The
love as redirected to the first parent-substitutes after a time
itself begins to meet with opposition from other psychic
tendencies on account of the too great similarity or the too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
firm associative connection between the original object and its
substitutes. Thus the existence of anything like erotic feeling
towards brothers, sisters, or other members of the family or
towards persons resembling the parents in age or appearance
ceases to be tolerated and at each fresh choice of object the
associative link becomes less marked, so that finally it may
cease altogether to be traceable. Thus at maturity the individual
should, for practical purposes, be free to direct his love towards
those who show no resemblance of any kind to the first object
of his dawning affection. This may be looked upon as the
normal goal of the development of the love impulse in relation
to its objects. Any failure to attain this goal must, it would
seem, be regarded as constituting to some extent a failure or
arrest of development with respect to this highly important
aspect of the individual's mental growth.</p>

THE FAMILY AND THE LIFE TASK OF THE INDIVIDUAL</h2>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="p5">FREUD AND JUNG</p>


<p>In this short sketch of what&mdash;from the results of psycho-analytic
<span class="sidenote">Non-sexual
aspects of
Individual
development
in relation to
the family</span>
and other investigations&mdash;we may regard as the normal
development of the individual mind in regard to the family
relationships, we have hitherto been concerned more particularly
with the sexual emotions and tendencies, using the word sexual
in the wide sense current among writers of the psycho-analytic
school. This has been the case, partly because in our account
we have been largely governed by historical considerations with
regard to the actual chronology of recent psychological progress
in this field (and it was chiefly the sexual aspects of the family
relationships that were first brought to light in the course of
this progress); partly also because it is with regard to these
sexual aspects that the increase of our knowledge through the
application of new psychological methods has been in many
ways the most extensive, the most startling and the most difficult
to assimilate. The results considered in the last two
chapters are of such a nature as to have been for the most
part unrealised and unsuspected either by the professional
psychologist or by the ordinary student of human nature: they
are, indeed, of such a kind as could only be obtained by means
of a special technique capable of overcoming the formidable
resistances which, as we have seen, are interposed between the
conscious and the unconscious levels of the mind.</p>

<p>The positive results of recent research on the psychological
influences of the family as regards matters less directly connected
with sexuality are of a less unexpected kind, and seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to lie to some extent in the direct path of psychological
progress even apart from the introduction of the methods of
psycho-analysis. Nevertheless, it is the use of these methods that
has given some precision to our knowledge in these respects
also, and rendered more certain and definite what before
was but vaguely suspected. At this point, therefore, it becomes
necessary to review the principal results of psycho-analytic
research with regard to these non-sexual aspects of mental
development in relation to the family environment.</p>

<p>The treatment of these non-sexual aspects is of special
<span class="sidenote">Controversies
on this subject</span>
difficulty for two reasons. In the first place, these aspects are,
in their actual occurrence, intimately bound up with the
processes of sexual development with which we have been
dealing; and are often difficult to disentangle from them. In
the second place, this very question of the distinction of the
sexual from the non-sexual aspects of the observed facts of
development has recently been, and still is, a subject of keen
dispute among certain members of the psycho-analytic and post-psycho-analytic
schools. The authors who have dealt more
especially with the non-sexual aspects have written largely
under the influence of this dispute and from a somewhat
different point of view from that of the writers who have laid
the principal emphasis upon the sexual side. Hence a comparison
of the chief contributions on the two aspects is not always
easy. In spite of these difficulties, however, certain conclusions
stand out with some degree of clearness from the mists of
controversy, and these are of considerable importance for our
present purpose.</p>

<p>In the course of his pioneer work, Freud himself had in
more than one connection drawn attention to the importance
of the family relationships in regard to the general development
of character and vital activity of the individual. It is however
<span class="sidenote">The work of
Jung</span>
more especially to C. G. Jung of Zürich that we are indebted
for a more explicit, vigorous and extended treatment of the
problems of the family from this point of view<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. The more
recent work of Jung is marred by an exaggerated insistence on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a single aspect, and by a tendency to mysticism which is apt
to confuse and obscure the scientific consideration of the
problem. But in spite of these defects it undoubtedly contains
many contributions of value and, especially when taken as
complementary to, rather than opposed to, the work of Freud,
Rank and others of the orthodox psycho-analytic school, it would
seem to constitute in some ways an important step forward in
our knowledge of the matters with which we are here concerned.</p>

<p>Jung's present position is, in many respects, a reaction
against Freud's views as to the extreme importance of the
sexual tendencies in mental life. With Freud the term Libido
had been used to signify the sum total of these tendencies
taken in a sense much wider than that which seems to have
been contemplated by any previous writer; so wide indeed
that many inferred that there could be but a small field left
over for the operation of the other instincts and tendencies.
With Jung the reaction against this attitude takes place not by
a restriction of the term Libido to its former narrower sense,
but by a still further extension of its meaning so as to include
all the conative tendencies which manifest themselves in mental
life. By so doing Jung is enabled to take up a relatively non-committal
attitude as regards the sexuality or non-sexuality of
many of the factors which Freud had regarded as definitely
sexual in character, while at the same time he succeeds in
minimising the importance of certain unmistakably sexual manifestations
by ignoring their specific character and regarding
them rather exclusively from the point of view of the
development and value of the individual as an independent
vital unit.</p>

<p>As regards the application of this general attitude to our
<span class="sidenote">The family and
the development
of the
individual</span>
own immediate problem, Jung appears to look upon the family
influences as principally of importance in so far as they afford
the necessary conditions and mental environment for the growth
of the general life force of the individual personality. The child
at birth is entirely dependent on his parents for the satisfaction
of his vital needs. His development and education would
appear to consist ultimately in the process of learning to satisfy
these ever increasing needs himself. Hence if the child remains
dependent on his parents for an abnormal length of time or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
an abnormal extent, we may infer that an arrest of development
has taken place. Such arrests are however liable to occur in a
great many cases, since the process of learning to satisfy our
own needs by our own efforts is an arduous business which
(in virtue, we may suppose, of some aspect of the law of
inertia) many of us would fain escape if we could. Undue
dependence on the family would therefore appear to indicate a
shirking of the "life task," <em>i. e.</em> an unwillingness to make the
effort which adult life itself demands, manifesting itself in an
exaggerated tendency to remain at the stage of relatively slothful
ease and maintenance through the efforts of others which is
enjoyed in infancy and early childhood.</p>

<p>In the neuroses the patient suffers, according to Jung, from
<span class="sidenote">Attachment to
the parents
regarded as
symbolic of
deficient
individual
development</span>
an unconscious tendency to return to this happy state of affairs
rather than to face the hard struggle which adult life may
entail. This tendency expresses itself in a symbolic way,
according to the mechanisms which are characteristic of the
neuroses; and what better or more appropriate symbol is
possible than some form of exaggerated attachment to, and
dependence on, the parents&mdash;through whom alone that happy
time, to which return is now desired, was possible? Thus it
would appear from this point of view that the incestuous
fancies and wishes, to which Freud had drawn attention, are
not to be taken literally as the expression of ultimate desires,
but are only symbols of the wish to escape the hard task which
life imposes and to return once more to the irresponsible condition
of childhood.</p>

<p>There are probably no experienced psycho-analysts who
are prepared to follow Jung to this last extreme position, in
which he appears to deny all ultimate significance to the sexual
<span class="sidenote">Difficulties
presented by
this view</span>
aspects of the family complexes. Jung's view would seem indeed
to involve a number of serious difficulties, amongst which the
following are perhaps the most important.</p>

<p>(1) It does not (as does the view expounded in the earlier
chapters) cast any light upon the origin and development of,
<span class="sidenote">It does not
accord with
the general
importance
of sex</span>
nor is it altogether consistent with, the very important part
which the sexual tendencies play in the conscious and unconscious
mind, quite apart from incestuous desires and fancies. If
the principal problem of the neurotic lies in the difficulty of
bracing himself to face the tasks which life imposes, it is hard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
see why sexual feelings, thoughts, phantasies and symbols should
appear in his mind so frequently and so persistently as they are
now generally admitted to do in a very large number of cases.</p>

<p>(2) Jung's view does not explain why the thought of
<span class="sidenote">It does not
explain the
strong repression
of incest</span>
incestuous relations should be subject to so much repression
as it actually is. If there is in reality no deep-rooted tendency
to such relations, there is no need for the formation of any
powerful mechanism for preventing the fulfilment of the tendency;
whereas if we suppose that the arousal of object love in an
incestuous form is a normal stage of libido development&mdash;a
stage however which is superseded in the course of further
normal development&mdash;the existence of a strong counter-mechanism,
manifesting itself in consciousness as repulsion and disgust,
and in social life in the form of sexual taboos and
"avoidances" connected with the various prohibited relationships,
is precisely what our knowledge of the general conditions of
the development of conative tendencies in the human mind
would lead us to expect.</p>

<p>(3) Even if we are prepared to grant that this repression
<span class="sidenote">Nor the choice
of incest as a
symbol</span>
may have arisen from some other cause, it still remains difficult
to account for the fact that the desire to return to infantile
conditions should persistently avail itself of such an objectionable
symbolic form. We should expect that the path of least
resistance would lead to some means of symbolic expression
calculated to arouse less opposition on the part of conflicting
tendencies than that to which the idea of incestuous relationship
is exposed. This leads to a fourth and still more serious
objection on general grounds.</p>

<p>(4) Jung's view seems incompatible with all we know as
<span class="sidenote">It is not in
harmony with
the general
laws of
symbolism</span>
to the general relations of Repression and Displacement to
conscious and unconscious factors respectively. The general
rule, which is exemplified in innumerable dreams, myths,
neurotic symptoms and cases of "everday psychopathology"
would appear to be that the symbol expresses some tendency
or desire in the unconscious which is more opposed to conscious
tendencies and desires than is the symbol itself<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>. But in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the present case, if Jung's view were correct, this rule would
no longer hold. The desire for incestuous relations with one's
parents is obviously exposed to much more serious inhibitions
at the conscious level than is the desire to escape from the
labours and responsibilities of adult life. The latter desire,
although it may of course become the object of moral disapproval
is generally of a nature to be freely admitted to
consciousness. The idea of our own laziness or want of courage
in meeting the difficulties of life can be faced by most of us
(including the class of neurotics who, according to Jung's hypothesis,
must, it would seem, have fallen ill owing to the repression
of the desires connected with these ideas) without
arousing any overwhelming sense of moral turpitude; whereas
the idea of incest, even in the case of others, meets with the
greatest abhorrence, and in relation to ourselves usually encounters
sufficient opposition to be kept out of waking consciousness
altogether. It would therefore seem that, on Jung's
view, it is the conscious which is symbolised at a relatively unconscious
level&mdash;a complete reversal of the usual order which,
on the ground of the psycho-analytic knowledge already gained,
must be regarded as highly improbable, at any rate in so far
as it is to be looked upon as a full explanation of the
phenomena under discussion.</p>

<p>It would thus appear that we have good reasons for
<span class="sidenote">Such a view
cannot afford
a complete
explanation
though it may
contain certain
valuable elements
of truth</span>
rejecting the view that the apparently sexual manifestations of
love by the child towards its parents are only symbols of the
desire to return to the state of tutelage and protection enjoyed
in early years. It does not follow, however, that the whole of
Jung's conclusions as regards the relation of the parent
complexes to the development of individuality in the child are
to be rejected. On the contrary, it is almost certain that they
contain valuable truths which had to some extent been overlooked,
or at any rate had received less attention than they
deserved, in some of the earlier investigations. Even as regards
the symbolisation of the developmental tendencies in the incest
fancies, Jung may be right in a number of important points. It
is only so far as he would maintain that such symbolisation
exhausts the whole significance of the incest tendencies that he
is almost certainly in error.</p>

<p>The possibility of a further analysis of the incest tendencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Overdetermination
and the
multiple
interpretation
of symbols</span>
in a non-sexual sense is implied by what Freud has himself
taught as regards the laws governing the formation of symbols,
more especially by the doctrine of Overdetermination<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>, according
to which a single dream symbol or neurotic symptom may
often be found to constitute a complete or partial fulfilment of
two or more distinct wishes or conative tendencies. Moreover,
at least two authors besides Jung have carried out analyses in
this sense. Silberer<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> has shown that a number of myths and
fairy tales may be interpreted in at least two ways:&mdash;first, as
an expression of the Œdipus complex as outlined in our previous
chapters; secondly, as the expression of certain moral or
religious strivings, which he calls the anagogic aspect; the
symbolism in this latter case being of the "functional" kind
(<em>i. e.</em> expressive of mental processes and tendencies rather than
of the objects of feeling and cognition), to the existence of which
Silberer had already drawn attention in his earlier works<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.
Ferenczi<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> (following Schopenhauer) has seen in the Œdipus
myth the existence of certain functional symbolisms in virtue
of which the character of Œdipus and Jocasta (as drawn by
Sophocles) stand for opposing tendencies in the mind brought
out by the tragic situation, <em>viz.</em> the tendency, on the one hand, to
bring all the facts of the case into the clear light of consciousness,
even at the risk of painful discoveries; and on the other
hand the contrary tendency to repress and prohibit all further
inquiry for fear of such discoveries.</p>

<p>In so far as these attempts have been successful (and in
<span class="sidenote">Overdetermination
in the case of
the Œdipus
Complex</span>
the case of Silberer's work at any rate the evidence brought
forward in favour of the simultaneous existence of the two
tendencies as symbolised in the same legend would appear to
be very considerable) they afford some ground for accepting
Jung's interpretation of the incest fancies as constituting, in
one of their aspects, an expression of certain ideas and tendencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
relating to the original conditions of dependence in which a
child stands towards its parents&mdash;tendencies which exist alongside,
and to some extent independently, of the sexual tendencies
to which expression is more directly and obviously given.</p>

<p>The symbolic expression in this case, however, would appear
to differ in some important respects from symbolic representation
(in dreams and elsewhere) of the Œdipus complex proper. In
the latter the symbolic form is largely, if not entirely, due to
the action of Repression, which does not permit the morally
tabooed incestuous and hostile tendencies to find expression in
any but an indirect manner, whereas in the present case the
aspects symbolised are not in any sense repressed, so that the
reason for the adoption of the symbolic form must be sought
in other conditions.</p>

<p>Among these conditions the most important is probably to
<span class="sidenote">as a product
of repression</span>
be found in the still active repression of the Œdipus complex
itself. In so far as the ideas connected with this complex can
be given another meaning, such as that indicated by Jung,
their offensiveness is not felt to be so great as would be the
case if their only significance were that which most naturally
attaches to them: the assumption of the new symbolic meaning
is indeed, in all probability, largely due to the effort of the
repressing tendencies to prevent their true significance from
being realised in consciousness<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>. The new meaning, therefore,
as interpreted by Jung, Silberer and others, obviously corresponds
to a more recent and superficial (though not therefore
less real) mental level than does the original significance in
terms of the Œdipus complex.</p>

<p>Another reason for the adoption of this secondary
<span class="sidenote">and as serving
to reinforce the
moral tendencies</span>
symbolism is probably sometimes to be found in the fact that
the ethical or religious strivings expressed in the anagogic
aspects undergo a very considerable reinforcement through
association with the primitive trends which manifest themselves
in the Œdipus complex. The latter lie very much nearer to the
ultimate sources of human feeling and emotion than do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
former, which, by themselves in their abstract purity, are apt
to be only too ineffectual as motives of desire and conduct.
But when clothed in the symbolic form of the Œdipus complex,
they at once acquire some of the primitive energy inherent
in the latter and so become themselves more powerful at the
same time as they serve to purify and elevate what remains of
the grosser elements of the original love and hate that the
child has felt towards its parents. Symbolisation of lofty aims
and motives in terms of primitive emotions called up by the
family relationships is thus, from this point of view, an example
of the process of sublimation, whereby the energy of the simpler
and cruder human tendencies becomes diverted to the service
of ends of higher cultural and social value<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a><span class="small80">CHAPTER V</span><br />
<br />
THE FAMILY AND THE GROWTH OF INDIVIDUAL
PERSONALITY</h2>


<p>The considerations raised at the end of the last chapter
<span class="sidenote">We must recognise
both
the sexual and
the individual
aspects of
development</span>
were somewhat in the nature of a digression. Such a digression
was however inevitable, for the questions involved in the
controversy between the psychological schools of Vienna and
Zürich (whose leading exponents are Freud and Jung respectively)
are of fundamental importance for our present inquiry. Our
whole attitude towards the psychological problems presented
by the family relationships must to a very considerable extent
depend upon whether we believe, as the more extreme exponents
of the Zürich school would sometimes seem to do, that the
whole significance of these problems lies in the fact that they
are intimately concerned with the development of the vital
energies and independence of the individual, or whether
(following the Vienna school) we feel bound to recognise also
the existence of a number of highly important sexual aspects
which, directly or indirectly, play a fundamental rôle in the
psychology of the family.</p>

<p>Our short review of the principal points concerned in this
controversy (so far as they touch our present purpose) has led
us to the conclusion that the sexual aspects with which we
were dealing in Chapters II and III possess more than a mere
symbolical significance&mdash;that they must in fact be looked upon
as, for the most part, actually being that which they appear
to be, <em>i. e.</em> manifestations of (relatively) infantile tendencies
which, as regards their nature and origin, are continuous with,
and comparable to, the fully developed sexual tendencies of
adult life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>We concluded also, however, that besides these sexual
aspects there are other important aspects of family life, which
may legitimately be looked upon as fundamental factors in the
psychic growth and development of individuality. These factors
it is now our duty to study somewhat more closely, before we
pass on (as we shall do in the next chapter) to consider the
variations and abnormalities that may occur in the development
of the individual's mental attitude towards the other members
of his family.</p>

<p>Apart altogether from the questions of mysticism and
<span class="sidenote">Difficulties of
individual
development</span>
symbolism, with which Jung and his followers have tended to
surround the whole matter, it is I think, abundantly clear that
normal psychic development involves a gradual emergence from
a condition of dependence on parental authority and care to
one in which the individual is dependent to a greater or less
extent upon his own efforts as regards his livelihood, and upon
his own judgment as regards his conduct<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. Failure in such
development will result in a relatively feeble adult personality&mdash;one
which still seeks the support of its parents (or their
substitutes), when it should have learnt to stand alone. Such
failures are, however, (as all psycho-analysts will admit) of very
frequent occurrence. Normal development in this respect
appears to be at least as difficult as in the case of the sexual
tendencies we have already considered, and is liable, as in
their case also, to arrests and retardations at various points
and to regressions to earlier stages of development, whenever
serious obstacles and difficulties are encountered.</p>

<p>It would seem possible to distinguish two main aspects of
<span class="sidenote">Self-preservation</span>
this process of development, though in real life these two
aspects are, it is almost needless to say, throughout intimately
connected with one another. The first, and more primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
aspect, is that which is concerned with the actual manifestations
of vital activity for the purpose of self-preservation and for
bringing about the fulfilment of the individual's aims and desires.
During babyhood the child is almost entirely dependent on his
parents or other grown-up persons for the accomplishment of
these objects: at best he can only indicate by cries or gestures
the nature of his wants, in order that others may satisfy them.
As he grows older however, he has to learn to fulfil an ever
increasing number of these wants himself&mdash;to feed, to wash, to
clothe himself and to satisfy his other bodily needs, to walk
abroad without the protection and guidance of his elders, and
generally to attain his desires by his own efforts rather than
to wait for the attentions of others. To keep pace with the
ever growing wants and desires of the individual, a continuous
output of energy is required, and it will sometimes happen that
the motive force immediately available (the strength of the
conation) is not sufficient to overcome the obstacles which
prevent the fulfilment of a want. When this is the case, the
individual may react in a variety of ways. If the conation is
a relatively weak one, he may abandon his attempts to attain
the desired end, at least in its original form; or he may content
himself with an imaginary fulfilment of his desire. If the
conation is sufficiently strong, however, it may continue to
manifest itself in different ways; if the first means of approach
is unsuccessful, other means will be tried, until the end is
eventually attained. Of these other means, one that is frequently
among the most effectual is to call in the assistance of others.
Especially is this the case in infancy when many feats that are
difficult or impossible to the child are easily performed by its
parents or other adult persons, and when such persons
(especially the parents) often take a delight in assisting the child
in this way. That the child should receive such assistance is
natural and inevitable at a certain stage of development, but
it is easy to see that help thus given may constitute a source
of danger to the child's development, if it is granted not only
in cases of real difficulty (having regard to the child's age
and capabilities) but in cases where, by the expenditure of a
little additional effort, the child could attain his end unaided. If
assistance is given indiscriminately the child may acquire the
habit of relying upon the help of others whenever any difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
arises; and this habit may persist throughout life, rendering
the individual a relatively useless and helpless member of
society, incapable of any prolonged or intensive effort<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>. Normal
development, however, implies that the occasions on which
assistance is required should grow fewer and fewer as ability
and experience increase, so that the adult should finally be able
to transact the ordinary business of life and to maintain himself,
entirely by his own efforts, except of course in unusual or
exceptionally difficult circumstances, or where the economic
principle of the division of labour makes it desirable to call in
the assistance of other persons possessing ability or training of
a different nature to his own.</p>

<p>The other main aspect of the principle of development
<span class="sidenote">Self-determination</span>
that we are considering, is concerned with the matter of self-guidance
rather than with that of self-help. In this respect also,
normal development implies a change from dependence
upon others to dependence upon self. In infancy a very
great part of the individual's mode of life is determined
by others, and especially by his parents. Just as he is
dependent upon the efforts of his parents for the necessaries
of life, so is he also dependent upon their decision
as to how and when he shall enjoy these necessaries. He feeds,
walks, sleeps, works and plays very largely according to their
pleasure. At most the nature of his play activities is left to his
own discretion. Later on during the school period the authority
of the parents is to some extent exchanged for that of his
teachers, but it is not till a comparatively late stage of development
that an individual is allowed to dispose of the bulk of his time
as he himself thinks fit.</p>

<p>On the moral side, again, he is at first almost entirely
dependent on the judgment of others. He hears certain tendencies,
activities and sentiments condemned as wicked, others upheld<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
as praiseworthy, and even when he begins to pronounce moral
judgments on his own account, these judgments must, for a
long period, consist for the most part merely of fresh applications
of the moral code that he has learnt from others.</p>

<p>This subservience to the will and opinion of others (and
especially to those of the parents) is a necessary and natural
condition of early childhood, but it is plain that the successful
development of mind and character must demand a gradually
increasing degree of autonomy as regards both thought and
conduct, as capabilities mature and experience widens. Success
in adult life requires the capacity for determining for oneself
the nature and course of the principal activities&mdash;indeed, the
degree of success that is attained is to a very considerable
extent dependent on the amount of such capacity. He who can
only carry out the instructions of others, however obediently
and skilfully, is only fitted to occupy an inferior position in the
economic or the social scale. Hence, one who has never
progressed far from the infantile condition of dependence on
the commands and opinions of others will be lacking in one of
the character qualities which are essential for the attainment
of any high degree of individuality or of social and economic
responsibility.</p>

<p>On the moral side also, he is debarred from the higher
<span class="sidenote">Autonomy and
Moral
Development</span>
levels of ethical development. At the best, his morality will be
one of hard and fast rules, the dictates of parental, ecclesiastical,
legal or social authority, incapable of enlightened growth or
modification to suit the ever changing flow of circumstances
and the widening experience of life. At the worst, he may
grow up destitute of all true moral consciousness whatsoever,
morality being regarded by him as a certain (usually unpleasant)
kind of conduct, arbitrarily imposed by external authority, and
only fit to be abandoned as soon as the pressure of this
authority is relaxed.</p>

<p>Sound moral development is characterised by an ever
increasing degree of autonomy in place of the heteronomy
which distinguishes the immature, and to some extent, the
primitive mind generally. At first the child learns to act in
accordance with the desires of its parents, as expressed in
threats, punishments or rewards. Thereafter, the idea of "good,"
as signifying conduct in accordance with these desires, becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
operative as an inner motive force in the mind of the child,
independently of the occurrence of the rewards or other
incentives. This is the first stage of autonomy. As development
proceeds, the ideas concerning right conduct (continually
enlarged by the experience of new persons and new situations)
become more and more dissociated from their original authoritative
sanctions, new "inner" sanctions being substituted for
the old "external" ones which are abandoned. These inner
sanctions are themselves capable of many different levels of
development, ranging from the simple idea of the individual's
own benefit in the immediate future, to the desire for the
ultimate benefit of humanity as a whole or the concept of action
in conformity with the general principles of the Universe. If
the individual is to progress satisfactorily from the stage of
outer sanctions to that of inner sanctions and to attain in due
course to the higher levels of these inner sanctions, he must
have opportunities for the gradual development of his own
powers of initiation, deliberation and self-control; this implying
a corresponding gradual emancipation from the jurisdiction of
the parents and their substitutes in later life (teachers, advisers,
superiors, <em>etc.</em>), until there is obtained at full growth the completest
possible autonomy of thought and action that is compatible
with the individual's position in the society to which he
belongs.</p>

<p>In these considerations we have throughout laid the
<span class="sidenote">Autonomy
should come
about
gradually</span>
principal emphasis upon the desirability and necessity of the
acquirement of self help and self guidance on the part of the
individual. This has been chiefly because the results of psycho-analytic
work have indicated that the danger lies most frequently
in the direction of too great, rather than of too little, dependence
on the efforts and guidance of the parents or their substitutes.
This fact must not however be allowed to blind us to the
existence of a danger of an opposite character&mdash;that of a too
rapid or too complete emancipation from parental authority.
Such emancipation would, it is true, seem to occur seldom
enough as a direct consequence of the unfolding of the child's
individual capabilities and desires: the attitude of dependence
necessarily adopted in childhood and early youth, together with
the respect almost inevitably inspired in the very young by the
greater power, knowledge and experience of the parents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
effectually prevents this in the majority of cases. But it may
easily come about as the result of a reaction against a too
<span class="sidenote">and not suddenly
as the
consequence
of a revolt
against parental
authority</span>
insistent or despotic use of the parental power. Parents who
are too severe, too repressive, or even too careful, as regards
the upbringing of their children, will&mdash;especially if the latter
happen to possess strong tendencies to self-assertion&mdash;often
bring about a state of revolt against their own authority, in
which all that may be good and wise in that authority is
deliberately neglected or condemned, since the children have
grown to look upon their parents as tyrants and taskmasters
rather than as helpers and protectors. A stern or bullying
father, a nagging or over anxious mother, will thus frequently
produce a rebellious son or daughter, who will respect neither
the advice or commands of the parents themselves nor those
of their (mental) substitutes in later life. Such children, as they
grow up, may be prevented from profiting to the desirable
extent by the wisdom and experience of past ages, as represented
in the traditions and dictates of authority, and (what is worse)
may even become unfit for taking their place in any scheme
of harmonious social life, through inability to submit to the
degree of individual subordination, which such social life
inevitably demands<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>.</p>

<p>These considerations with reference to the growth of the
<span class="sidenote">The wider
social bearings
of this subject</span>
individual personality in relation to the family environment
are indeed, as we have already pointed out, for the most part
of a sufficiently obvious character and, in their more general
bearings at any rate, have for some time been commonplaces
in certain schools of social, ethical, and educational thought.
Where modern psychology (and particularly the work of the
Zürich school) has been of service, is in drawing attention to
the importance of the family as the environment in which the
first steps in the path of self help and self guidance must take
place&mdash;steps upon the direction and extent of which subsequent
progress in the wider spheres of scholastic, social and political
life very greatly depends. The rapidity with which, and the
extent to which, a child attains to independence in relation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
his family, are to a large extent prophetic of the subsequent
attainment of independence towards the world at large. A too
close reliance upon the ideals, standards, conventions and
protective power of the family circle may hinder all initiative
and originality in individual thought and action. On the other
hand, a too sudden or too complete revolt from the parental
guidance and tradition may be productive of a bias against,
and disrespect for, every kind of authority and convention, that
will tend to prevent all use and enjoyment of the experience
of the past and all orderly co-operation in the social life of the
present. With these possibilities as the result of failure, the
task of the proper upbringing of the child in relation to his
family environment becomes indeed one the importance of which
can scarcely be exaggerated.</p>

<br />
ABNORMALITIES AND VARIETIES OF DEVELOPMENT&mdash;LOVE
AND HATE</h2>


<p>Up to this point, in studying the process of individual
<span class="sidenote">The study of
the abnormal
in Psychology</span>
development in relation to the family environment, we have as
far as possible confined our attention to the more normal
aspects of this process, neglecting for the most part the many
variations and aberrations to which it is liable. It is now time
to explore more carefully some of the more important of these
byways into which the human mind may wander in the course
of its development&mdash;byways which we have hitherto passed unnoticed,
or at most examined with a hasty glance, as we traced
the direct path of emotional development from childhood to
maturity. Some of these byways lie near to the direct path
which we have already followed; others depart more widely
from it, approaching near to, or sometimes definitely entering,
the region of the abnormal or pathological.</p>

<p>As regards these latter, however, it must be borne in mind
that here (as in most other cases of the treatment of the abnormal
in Psychology) the distinction between normal and abnormal
is one which is drawn for the sake of practical convenience
only, and which indicates merely a difference of
degree not a difference in quality, between the phenomena
which it distinguishes. Even those manifestations which mark
the most extreme departures from the normal are present as
possibilities in all of us: it is only a question of the extent of
our tendency towards them and of the intensity of the predisposing
causes in our environment. A slight alteration in the
balance of our mental forces or in the circumstances of our
life and upbringing, and we too might fall victims to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
aberrations which now seem to us so repulsive, foolish or
ridiculous, when displayed by others. The abnormal in Psychology
is most frequently only an aspect of the normal magnified
beyond its usual dimensions and thus brought out of proportion
to the other aspects of the mind. For this reason the study of
the abnormal is often the best means of investigating the minute
structure of the normal: and in the present case we shall find
that when we have reviewed the principal abnormalities and
variations in the psychic development of the individual in
relation to his family, we shall be in a much more favourable
position for arriving at a decision as to our own attitude&mdash;theoretical
and practical&mdash;towards this development than if we
had simply considered the process of growth in its strictly
normal aspects.</p>

<p>Byways in human development, both emotional and intellectual,
<span class="sidenote">Abnormalities
of development
at different
levels</span>
may diverge from the main track at various points in
its course&mdash;some near its origin in the infantile strata of the
mind, some at a later stage of progress. Those which leave
the main track at a relatively early point preserve, as a rule,
throughout their course some more or less definite indication
of their early origin, some trace of infantile or childish character;
while those which take their departure at a subsequent stage
bear the marks of a later, but still immature, condition of
development. As each variation or aberration thus, to some
extent, corresponds in nature to the point of development at
which it took its rise, it is possible to classify such variations
and aberrations according to their point of origin; and to regard
each one as a fixation or arrest of development at a certain
point in the main track of progress. What is true of human development
in general is true more particularly of the development
of the individual's relation to his family. The more primitive variations
will be found to bear the characteristics of the early stages
of the individual's mental growth while the later variations
will indicate a more advanced condition of this growth.</p>

<p>In the previous chapters we have seen that in the earliest
stages of development the most important psychic reactions of
the child (so far as they concern us here) are those connected
with the parents. At a later stage, the tendencies and emotions
originally centering in the parents undergo (under the influence
of Repression) a process of Displacement on to other persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and objects. This important fact in the process of development
may serve us as a preliminary basis of classification in dealing
with the numerous variations which we shall encounter. We
shall first undertake a review of the more primitive types of
variation in which the abnormal elements are directly connected
with the child's relations to its parents, passing on subsequently
to the more complex types in which a well marked displacement
of the child's original feelings has taken place, as the result of
which the abnormality is no longer directly connected with the
parents themselves but with a substitute for these.</p>

<p>As regards the first class, the general nature of the psychic
<span class="sidenote">Abnormalities
and variations
in the parent&mdash;regarding
tendencies</span>
defects which may be met with is, in the main, familiar to us
from our consideration of the early stages of normal development.
If any of the features of the individual's relations to his
parents which we there passed in review&mdash;the love and hate
aspects of the Œdipus complex, the dependence on the efforts
of the parents as regards self maintenance and preservation,
the general obedience to, and reliance on, the authority of the
parents&mdash;should persist at a relatively advanced age in anything
like their original quality and intensity, then there exists one
of the defects in question. Not that any of these features will
be found to manifest themselves (except perhaps on rare
occasions) in exactly their original form and manner. The
general mental and moral growth of the intervening years
usually ensures that many of these features shall have undergone
a process of repression in virtue of which they are no
longer permitted to express themselves fully and openly in
consciousness. More especially is this the case with regard to
the love and hate elements in the psychic relationship of the
individual to his parents. These will seldom manifest themselves
quite openly and directly though they may attain to indirect
expression in dreams, neurotic symptoms, fancies and (as Rank
has so abundantly shown) in works of art. The psycho-analytic
treatment of these productions has shown, however, that the
original tendencies may persist in their crude form in the unconscious;
and thence may exercise a profound influence on
character and mental life.</p>

<p>In so far as, under the force of the repression, these
<span class="sidenote">Fixation at the
stage of parent
love</span>
tendencies do not suffer some clearly marked modification or
displacement as regards their object (and thus fall within our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
second class of abnormalities), the conflict to which their
continued existence gives rise is apt to manifest itself most
prominently in one or more of the negative forms characteristic
of repression, rather than in any positive form indicative of the
original nature of the repressed desire<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>. Thus a fixation (as it
is now usually called) of the love impulses on the parent of
the opposite sex may betray itself, on the positive side, in a
relatively sublimated and asexual manner only&mdash;as in a more
than usual degree of friendly affection, esteem or veneration
for, or in an abnormal degree of dependence on, the parent in
question; combined perhaps with an unusually strong desire
for the presence of the loved parent, and a feeling of contentment
with life in the parent's home that leads to a relative want of
interest in persons and things outside it, and a liability to
home-sickness if compelled to be away from home or parent<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.
The sexual nature of the (unconscious) source of this attitude
reveals itself however unmistakably in the negative aspects of
the conflict to which it gives rise. Thus a parent fixation of
this kind may make itself felt negatively in an inability to
direct love freely and fully upon any other person of the
same sex as the loved parent. The normal process of falling
in love in adolescence or early maturity may fail to take place;
the persons concerned are content to live quietly at home with
their parents; if sexual relations are attempted, psychic impotence
or frigidity&mdash;relative or absolute&mdash;may result<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>; marriage will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
frequently be avoided, or will be entered into from motives
other than those of real affection<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>&mdash;sometimes from the very
need to escape from an unconscious incestuous desire.</p>

<p>These negative manifestations, like so many others of a
<span class="sidenote">Conflict and
Compromise</span>
similar kind, are the result of two distinct and conflicting
tendencies in the mind, and (as is usual in such cases) are of
such a nature as to give at any rate some degree of satisfaction
to both these tendencies at the same time. In the first place
they give expression to the psychic forces engaged in the
repression of the primitive incestuous trends; with the
exaggeration and want of discrimination characteristic of repression,
the taboo originally applicable to one particular object (the
parent) is extended to all objects towards which similar feelings
could be experienced; thus producing an inhibition of a general
kind upon a whole class of feelings as such, where an inhibition
of a specific kind upon a particular manifestation of such
feelings (<em>i. e.</em> their manifestation in an incestuous direction)
was all that was originally intended or required. In the second
place, these predominantly negative aspects of fixation contain
also some elements of positive gratification of the repressed
tendencies. In the failure to extend any considerable degree of
affection upon a new object (parent substitute), the mind expresses
its abiding fidelity to its first love-object (the actual parent) and
its refusal to abandon the satisfaction which it continues to find
in this object, in spite of the difficulties and prohibitions
connected with this infantile direction of the love impulses and
the prospect of greater freedom in other directions. This double
nature of the negative aspects of fixation on the love-object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
early childhood affords a striking instance of the compromise
formations which so frequently arise in the course of mental
development as the result of struggle between conflicting
tendencies.</p>

<p>In a number of cases the repression of an incestuous
<span class="sidenote">Homosexuality
as a result of
incestuous
fixation</span>
affection for a parent may manifest itself not merely in relative
indifference to the attractions of others of the same sex as that
of the loved parent but, more violently, in active dislike of
persons of that sex. This condition is usually associated with a
direction of affection upon persons of the individual's own sex
in such quality and such degree as is normally found only
where persons of the opposite sex are concerned. Indeed it has
been found that this process constitutes an important factor in
the history of a large number of cases of homosexuality. In
these cases the repression of the original love of the parent of
the opposite sex has led, first, to an extension of the love
taboo to all persons of that sex, and then, as a further step,&mdash;the
way to all heterosexual affection being now barred&mdash;to the
displacement of sexual desire into the homosexual direction.
Some indication of the secondary and derivative character of
these cases of homosexuality is, however, often to be found in
the nature of the object selected, this object usually presenting
some resemblance to the opposite sex for which it serves as
substitute, <em>e. g.</em> some delicacy, tenderness or effeminacy in the
case of men or boys and some quality of unusual strength or
"mannishness" in the case of women<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</p>

<p>On <em>a priori</em> grounds we might expect to find that in other
cases of homosexuality the direction of affection is determined
in a more direct manner, <em>viz.</em> by the fixation of an original infantile
attachment to the parent of the <em>same</em> sex as that of the
child. This might seem especially liable to occur in the case of
women, who for one reason or another have never completed
the step from a predominance of mother love (usually, as we
have seen, the first form of object love with children of both
sexes) to a predominance of father love<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>With men, too, it is possible that an overstrong affection
and admiration for the father may lead to a corresponding
result. In these cases we should expect the homosexuality to be
of a deeper and more fundamental character than that referred
to above, the members of the lover's own sex exercising
attraction, as it were, on their own merits, and not merely as
substitutes for the forbidden members of the opposite sex; the
objects selected being correspondingly typical of their own sex,
<em>i. e.</em> womanly women and manly men<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>. The existence of such
a type of homosexuality has indeed been demonstrated by
Ferenczi<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> (though here, as in most cases of "types" in psychology,
it is probable that the types themselves are only extreme
forms between which there exist an indefinite number of intermediate
characters, the majority of individuals partaking to some
extent of the nature of both types). So far as the evidence
goes, however, it would seem that the fixation of love on the
parent of the same sex plays a lesser part in the development
of this kind of homosexuality than might have been expected;
the homosexuality in question being more frequently and to a
greater extent due to a displacement of a primitive love of self
(Narcissism, in psycho-analytic terminology) projected on to
others, so that in loving those of his own sex the individual is
directing his affection to those who, by his unconscious mind,
are selected as the most suitable representatives of his own
beloved Ego.</p>

<p>It is an important characteristic of the phenomenon of
<span class="sidenote">Idealisation of
the loved
parent</span>
fixation on the parent, that this parent who is loved in the
unconscious is not so much the parent as he or she actually
exists when the child has attained to adolescence or maturity,
but rather the parent as he or she appeared to the child when
young, <em>i. e.</em> in the case of the father, a being of immeasurable
strength, wisdom, knowledge, authority and (perhaps) love; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the case of the mother, one of unsurpassable beauty, tenderness
and mercy and an ever available source of comfort, help and
protection in face of the difficulties and dangers of an unknown
and often hostile world. This idealisation of the loved parent
is especially liable to exercise a potent influence in all cases
where the parent in question dies young and is therefore never
subject to the criticism at the hands of his children to which
he would, later on, have inevitably to some extent become exposed.
In any case, however, it is not surprising that in comparison
with these beautiful products of the child's imagination
(for we can scarcely doubt that, here as elsewhere, the passage
of time has served to embellish still further the originally
exaggerated estimate of the admirable qualities of the loved
parent) the actual imperfect specimens of humanity who are
available as love objects in the real world have but little power
of attraction<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p>It is principally from this source that there is apt to rise the
fruitless search for the "ideal" man or woman&mdash;a search which
is bound to end in disappointment, because the object of the
search is to be found nowhere but in the distorted and idealised
memories cherished in the mind of the searcher himself.</p>

<p>It is this search for the ideal that has been found to
<span class="sidenote">Don Juanism
and the search
for the ideal</span>
underlie the inability to find permanent satisfaction in any
individual of the opposite sex; an inability of a most distressing
nature which characterises the love life of a certain class of
persons<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>. These unhappy Don Juans are perpetually attracted
to a fresh object by the promise of some new and indefinable
charm, only to suffer disappointment as each new object in
turn is found in some inexplicable way to fall short of the
lover's hopes and expectations. The misery which these
individuals, through their instability and faithlessness, are apt to
bring not only on themselves but on the unfortunate objects of
their love, is too well known to need further emphasis or
description. It is, however, paradoxically enough, the extreme
steadfastness of their love towards its original object that is the
cause of their fickleness towards all subsequent objects of
affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>As a result of this same process of idealisation, it may
<span class="sidenote">"Myth of the
birth of the
hero"</span>
also happen that the realisation of the true nature of the real
parents when compared with the beings corresponding to them
in imagination, may give rise to feelings of very bitter
disappointment. This disappointment is an experience so
widespread and of such deep emotional significance as to have
found expression in a frequently recurring type of myth and
legend, which has received illuminating treatment at the hands
of Freud and Rank<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. In these myths (of which the stories
connected with Moses, Perseus, Œdipus, Romulus, Cyrus,
Christ, Siegfried, Lohengrin afford typical examples) a child is
born of noble or divine parentage, but for some reason (usually
connected with hostility on the part of the father) is lost or
otherwise severed from his rightful home, and is reared by
foster parents of lowly station (or sometimes by animals), only
to be eventually restored to the position which is by birth his
due. Here the foster parents of the myth correspond to the
real parents as they are revealed to the disappointed insight
of the child who, with widening experience of his human
environment, begins to realise the discrepancy between the
actual position of his parents in the world of men and the
ideal qualities with which his infant's fancy had endowed them.
Unwilling however to give up the lofty conception of his
parents' dignity which he had formed for himself (the abandonment
of which involves of course not only a loss of cherished ideals
as regards his parents, but a serious readjustment of his views
as to his own prospects and importance<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>), the individual finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
in the noble parents of the myth the re-embodiment of those
conceptions which had become untenable as regards the real
world. The series of legends (in so far as they immediately
concern us here) thus serve to express the persistence in the
Unconscious of the original infantile idealisation of the parents
as a consolation for the loss of the parent ideal which an
appreciation of the actual human imperfections of the parents
has inevitably brought in its train.</p>

<p>The manifestations of the hate, as distinct from the love,
<span class="sidenote">Exaggerated
love concealing
hate</span>
elements of the Œdipus complex, may also, when subjected to
repression in the course of moral development, assume a negative
form&mdash;in this case usually appearing as a morbid and exaggerated,
but of course relatively superficial, love for the hated parent;
a love which constantly tends to find expression in somewhat
forced and unnatural exhibitions of affection. This superficial
love is often accompanied by an unreasoning anxiety as to the
welfare of the parent in question and a persistent dread lest
he or she should come to some harm. This symptom merely
constitutes a form of repression of the unconscious wish that
the parent <em>should</em> come to some harm. Persons afflicted with
a neurotic anxiety of this kind will frequently suffer very greatly
at the death of the parent concerning whom the anxiety is
felt; for this event constitutes the supreme gratification of the
unconscious and repressed desires, thus calling for an exceptionally
vigorous effort on the part of the repressing force in its endeavour
to substitute in consciousness an emotion of the opposite quality
to that which would be felt if the repressed tendencies held
undisputed sway.</p>

<p>Quite frequently however&mdash;in this respect unlike the
<span class="sidenote">Open parent-hatred</span>
love tendencies&mdash;the hate impulse may manifest itself with a
very considerable degree of frankness and directness, leading
to openly hostile relations to the parent, which may persist
throughout life. In such cases it will usually be found that the
original hatred as a consequence of jealousy or envy has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
supplemented by vindictive feelings arising from a (real
or imaginary) attitude of cruelty or tyranny on the part of the
hated parent towards the child or towards some third member
of the family, to whom the child's love and sympathy has
gone out.</p>

<p>This notion of cruelty and tyranny is indeed apt to play
a very important part in the attitude of children towards their
parents. The almost boundless power and authority which the
parent possesses over the very young child, combined with the
fact that this authority must often be exercised (even by the
most indulgent and considerate parents) in what appears to
the child a most arbitrary manner and one which displays a
ruthless disregard of his own desires and longings&mdash;all this
may bring about a sense of oppression and of being the victim
of a system of brutal force. Such feelings can only be removed
by a strong counter-impulse of affection and a gradual understanding
and assimilation of the parent's point of view, as
mental growth proceeds. If the original feeling of hostility
arising from the conflict between the parent's will and that of
the child should not be overcome&mdash;as may easily happen, if
(through some deficiency of tender feeling in the child himself
or as the result of some genuine want of consideration on the
part of the parent) the child should experience no compensatory
emotion of love towards the parent&mdash;then the hatred
thus aroused may persist with unabated vigour into adult life,
or even grow in strength as the years pass. The extraordinarily
intense bitterness which may be felt, for instance by a son
towards his father, may easily be realised by a study of a
number of well known literary works, <em>e. g.</em> many of the poems
of Shelley.</p>

<p>Another, but a later and usually less deep seated, cause
<span class="sidenote">Conflicting
interests of
parents and
children</span>
of hostile feelings in children towards their parents, is to be
found in the natural and to some extent inevitable competition
of the successive generations for the available sources of wealth
and power. This motive is apt to be experienced more strongly
among the relatively wealthy classes than among the relatively
poor, with whom under existing social conditions the children
may at a comparatively early age attain to an economic
position little if at all inferior to that of their parents. In many
well-to-do families, however, the prospect of succeeding at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
death of the parent to a considerable sum of money, a title,
or a recognised business, social, or professional position, will
frequently supply a motive for secretly desiring the death of
that parent&mdash;a motive which of course usually suffers a very
considerable degree of repression, but which nevertheless may
constitute a factor of importance in the determination of the
total psychic attitude of the child towards the parent. This is
especially liable to be the case where for any reason&mdash;<em>e. g.</em> an
extravagant mode of life on the part of the child or a want of
generosity on the part of the parent&mdash;the resources at the
disposal of the former are markedly insufficient for the satisfaction
of his needs (real or supposed), or again where the lack
of adequate funds is felt as a hindrance to some important
step in life, such as entering upon a marriage or upon some
business enterprise. Here the contrast between the economic
impotence of the child as compared with the greater resources
of his parents&mdash;coming, as it is apt to do, just at the period
of his most urgent desires and most ardent aspirations&mdash;is
only too likely to resuscitate the dead relics of infantile envy
and hostility. Such a revival, by the circumstances of later life,
of hate engendered during early years, can only be with
certainty avoided where the remains of such hatreds are no
longer persistent as distinct and powerful trends in the unconscious,
but have worked themselves off naturally and have lost
their power by absorption in the main tendencies and interests
of a healthy personality.</p>

<p>In a number of cases hatred may be felt, not&mdash;as usually
<span class="sidenote">Hatred of the
parent of the
child's own
sex</span>
happens&mdash;towards the parent of the same sex as that of the
child, but towards the parent of the <em>opposite</em> sex. This
abnormality may arise in some cases from a general tendency
to homosexuality on the part of the child, in which case he is
apt to suffer from an "inverted Œdipus complex", as Ferenczi
has termed it; love being felt towards the parent of the same
sex and jealousy towards the parent of the opposite sex; the
emotions being of the same quality as those met with in the
usual form of the complex but opposite in direction. Quite
apart, however, from any tendency to sexual inversion, the
hatred of the parent of the opposite sex may, in other cases,
arise secondarily as a consequence of the natural tendency of
this parent to display affection towards the other parent (<em>i. e.</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
from the child's point of view, to give undue attention to a
sexual rival). The hatred thus secondarily aroused towards the
original object of love may manifest itself openly in consciousness
or may suffer various degrees of repression, in the same
manner as the more usual hatred towards the parent of the
same sex. The importance and interest of this secondary hatred
lies principally in its influence on certain forms of displacement
to which we shall have to refer in a later chapter.</p>

<br />
ABNORMALITIES AND VARIETIES OF DEVELOPMENT&mdash;THE
DEPENDENCE ASPECTS</h2>


<p>In the fixations and regressions we have so far considered
<span class="sidenote">Failure to
become adequately
independent
of
the parents</span>
we were concerned more or less exclusively with the love and
hate aspects of the relations of the individual to his family.
We must now turn to consider the influence of these fixations
and regressions upon the rather wider problems of the individual's
development and attitude towards life as indicated in
Chapters IV and V.</p>

<p>The operation of any failures or abnormalities of development
<span class="sidenote">is subject to
less repression
than love or
hate fixations</span>
in this direction is for the most part subject to less intensive
and far reaching repressions than are met with in the
case of the love and hate aspects which we have just been
considering. That this is so will be readily understood if we
keep in mind the moral attitude generally adopted towards the
failures of development of the kind dealt with in Chapter V.
Laziness, inability to face the labours, troubles and difficulties
of adult life, unduly prolonged dependence upon the efforts of
the parents, these may indeed become objects of censure,
especially when present to an unusually marked extent; but
they arouse a degree of condemnation distinctly inferior to that
which is occasioned by the display of feelings of hatred or of
incestuous love towards the nearest relatives. The further
characteristics of want of personal initiative or of exaggerated
obedience to, and reliance on, the authority of the parents or
their substitutes, may easily come to be regarded as virtues
rather than as faults, since they are readily associated with the
qualities (desirable enough in a reasonable degree and in so
far as they do not interfere with the development of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
character) of conscientious execution of instructions and general
amenability to discipline in nursery and school or, later on, in
social, industrial or military life.</p>

<p>In consequence of this lesser liability to repression, any
failure in development as regards the aspects in question will
usually manifest itself in a positive rather than in a negative
form. In so far as the failure is of the nature of a simple arrest
or regression as distinct from a displacement (cases of which
will, in pursuance of our programme, be considered later), its
manifestations consist therefore, for the most part, of certain
characteristics proper to an earlier stage of development, but
which should have been outgrown in the process of normal
adaptation to adult life, and which, when persisting in an individual
of mature years, constitute, as has been sufficiently
shown in the earlier chapters, a serious obstacle to the full
enjoyment of a useful and successful life.</p>

<p>The attitude of the individual towards his life and work
may nevertheless be affected in a certain number of ways
which are less obvious in nature and which may therefore
well be mentioned here, especially as a considerable degree
of light has been thrown upon them by recent psycho-analytic
research.</p>

<p>In the first place it must be recognised that the degree of
<span class="sidenote">The influence
of heredity</span>
independence developed by an individual and the amount of
energy and self-reliance with which he faces the difficulties of
life, is apt to depend to a very considerable extent upon the
degree of development of these very same qualities in one or
both of the parents. No doubt, so far as concerns direct inheritance
of mental characteristics, there is a tendency, here as
elsewhere, for the child to develop qualities similar to those of
his parents. This inherited tendency may moreover be reinforced
as the result of precept and imitation, the child tending
naturally to follow his parents' instruction and example;
especially in so far as he admires and envies them or (as
almost inevitably happens to a greater or less extent) so far as
he&mdash;consciously or unconsciously&mdash;comes to regard them as
ideals to which he may himself hope one day to approximate.</p>

<p>On the other hand there are often certain influences at
<span class="sidenote">Psychological
influences may
cause strong</span>
work, which tend to make the child unlike his parents in just
these qualities of energy and self-reliance. Thus a high degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of initiative, self-confidence or masterfulness in the predominating
<span class="sidenote">parents to have
weak children
or vice versa</span>
parent may easily cause the child&mdash;unless himself endowed with
these characteristics to the same or to an even greater degree&mdash;to
abandon himself habitually to the supremacy and initiative of
the parent and thus in time to develop a lack of those qualities
which distinguished the personality of the latter. Conversely, a
lack of energy or authority in the parents may compel a child
to fall back constantly upon his own power of decision and
resource, thus developing in him, to some degree at least, those
character qualities in which his parents were defective. For
these reasons it may often happen that strong and masterful
parents have children who are relatively weak as regards
initiative and power of self-assertion, while these in turn may
be followed by a generation more resembling their grandparents
with respect to these qualities than their immediate predecessors.
This "alternation of generations" as regards certain important
mental powers and characteristics has attracted some attention
among students of heredity and some attempts have been made
to give a biological explanation of the problem, but as there
would seem to be no known laws of heredity which easily fit
the case, it is probable that we must regard the psychological
influences here indicated as the sole, or at least the chief,
causes of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Another way in which parents may influence the general
<span class="sidenote">Children may
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'indentify'">identify</ins> themselves
with
their parents</span>
attitude to life adopted by their children is through the direct&mdash;but
for the most part unconscious&mdash;identification by the latter
of themselves with their parents. We have already referred to
the conception frequently entertained by children of their parents
as ideals of humanity,&mdash;ideals the attainment of which may become
a constant source and driving power of effort. We have
seen too in the last chapter some of the evidence for the
potency of this ideal and the constancy with which it may be
cherished. This ideal, however, frequently serves not only as a
means of leading the child to embrace some general standard
or mode of life, but, more specifically also, as an incentive to
the adoption of the particular kind of business, profession,
hobby or amusement followed by the parent. Influence of this
sort is of course of especial importance in so far as it affects
the choice of a calling in life, and there can be little doubt
that in a large number of cases a son adopts his particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
means of earning his livelihood as the result of an unconscious
or semi-conscious identification of himself with his father. Sons
may also identify themselves with their mothers as regards their
principal pursuits in life; and (especially under present conditions
when work of almost every description is open to
women) daughters with either their fathers or their mothers.
In other cases again the choice is made in order to carry out
some wish&mdash;expressed or implied&mdash;on the part of the parent<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>,
or from a pious desire to carry on some work begun but not
completed by the parent.</p>

<p>In still other cases, however, a desire to be different from
<span class="sidenote">Desire to be
different from
the parent</span>
the parent rather than a desire to resemble him may be decisive.
When this is so, the calling chosen will probably be very
far removed in character from the parental one, except in so
far as it may resemble it through being the exact contrary,
where such a thing is possible; as for instance in politics or in
opposing schools of social, philosophic or religious thought.
The adoption of such a course depends naturally upon hatred
and aversion instead of love and admiration, and is due as
much to a desire to oppose the parent as to the wish to avoid
resembling him. It is especially liable to occur in cases where
the occupation or general behaviour of the parent has intruded
itself in an irksome and insistent manner into the life of the
child; and may lead not only to a dislike of the parent's occupation
itself, but to an opposition to the whole point of view
engendered by such an occupation, as the proverbial tendency
to loose living on the part of the sons of clergymen well illustrates<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, either positively or negatively, the lives, fates and
convictions of the parents have a great but often subtle power
in moulding the careers and opinions of their children&mdash;an influence
which, in so far as it is manifest, is generally recognised
as a force as great as, if not greater than, that of inherited
disposition or environmental suggestion; but which, in so far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
as it is not manifest except upon close psychological investigation,
constitutes a very considerable, but hitherto largely unsuspected,
force in shaping the destiny of the individual. It will be not
the least of the tasks of the psychological, educational and
economic sciences of the future to see that these forces, where
beneficial, shall be exploited to their full extent for the benefit
of the individual and of society, and, where harmful or
dangerous, shall be counteracted or guarded against by the best
means of which these sciences, in the course of their further
development, may stand possessed.</p>

<br />
IDEAS OF BIRTH AND PRE-NATAL LIFE</h2>


<p>We have now reached a point in our discussion at which
<span class="sidenote">Birth and
womb
phantasies</span>
we may perhaps profitably pause awhile to consider a group
of phantasies, which, on account of their widespread occurrence
and curious character, would seem to deserve some very special
attention at the hands of the psychologist and anthropologist.
The phantasies in question are those which psycho-analysts have
found to cluster round the idea of returning to the mother's
womb and of resuming there the intra-uterine life enjoyed by
the child in the pre-natal stages of its existence,&mdash;an idea which
is discoverable (usually of course in a symbolic form) in many
myths, legends, dreams, reveries and symptomatic actions. It is
very frequently associated with the further idea of birth or
re-birth, and it is in this form that the phantasy was first
described by Freud<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. In consciousness this phantasy of returning
<span class="sidenote">Manifestations
of the desire to
return to the
womb</span>
to the womb may clothe itself as an idea of being in an enclosed,
dark, solitary or inaccessible place, safe from outside dangers
or disturbances. Its influence can probably be traced in the
pleasure that many persons find in the retirement to small
islands, mountain tops or other places isolated from the rest of
the world, in the "cosiness" of small rooms or closets or in
the comfort which may be experienced in snuggling under the
bed-clothes in the presence of real or imaginary danger<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. Sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
itself, in its power of withdrawing the individual from the outer
world and in its unmistakable approximation to the pre-natal
condition of body and mind, may, from certain points of view,
be regarded as an exemplification of the same tendency<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> as
may also possibly hypnosis. In certain forms of insanity the
tendency may show itself quite clearly even in waking life, the
patient withdrawing himself as far as possible from all
environmental influences and sometimes adopting a characteristically
foetal posture,&mdash;a posture which, it should be noted, is
often adopted even by normal persons during sleep. More
moderately and within the bounds of sanity, it may show itself
in a relative degree of retirement from the world, as in the
life followed in Christian monasteries or nunneries, or&mdash;more
clearly&mdash;in the still more isolated existence of many Buddhist
monks and devotees, some of whom will live for years in caves
or other dark and secluded spots, almost entirely cut off
from human intercourse and from the light and bustle of the
outside world. In a more distinctly neurotic form again, its
influence may be traced in agoraphobia&mdash;the fear of open
spaces&mdash;or negatively (the reaction against the tendency predominating)
in its opposite, claustrophobia&mdash;the fear of narrow,
confined rooms or places&mdash;or in the morbid dread of being
buried alive.</p>

<p>In all these manifestations the dominant motive would seem
<span class="sidenote">Meaning of
this desire</span>
to consist in a desire to escape from the troubles, labours,
anxieties and excitements of the world, to a place where there
is rest and peace with no necessity for effort. Now there can
be no doubt that the intra-uterine life of the child represents
by far the nearest approach to such a blissful state of repose
that is ever enjoyed by us during any period of our earthly
existence. In this pre-natal life the child lives effortlessly, free
from danger and with all its needs provided; in striking contrast
to post-natal (and more especially adult) life, where in general
the stern rule holds that "if any will not work, neither shall
he eat", and where the individual constantly finds his strength
all too small to do battle with the formidable obstacles that so
often stand in the way of the fulfilment of his desires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>It is, as Ferenczi<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> has been at pains to show, only in so
<span class="sidenote">Difficulty of
the process of
adaptation to
reality</span>
far as we free ourselves from the habits, associations and
implications of this pre-natal life that we can learn to achieve
the fulfilment of our wishes by taking the necessary steps to
bring about their accomplishment in the outer world, instead
of endeavouring to make the outer world conform to our desires
by the shorter and easier method of imagination and delusion.
In the earliest stages of our existence we are in a sense indeed
omnipotent, inasmuch as provision is made for all our requirements
and desires as it were automatically and without the necessity
for effort on our own part. In early childhood this state persists
in some degree, the child's wants being, to a large extent,
fulfilled by others as soon as he indicates their nature. This
power of automatically bringing about the satisfaction of our
needs is destined to undergo a continually increasing degree of
restriction, as childhood changes through adolescence to maturity;
a greater individual adaptation to reality being achieved at the
cost of greater individual effort and of the loss of the childish
confidence in our ability to achieve our ends by the simple
process of desiring their achievement. Under the stresses and
difficulties of life on this developed plane, it is only too easy
to sink back to the earlier and simpler state where less effort
is demanded, and if we retrace our steps in this direction as
far as they will lead us, we return eventually to the primitive
condition of our pre-natal life. It is thus, apparently, that a
return to this earliest stage of our existence has come to stand
as the supreme goal and object of all desire to escape from
the turmoil, labour and conflict which developed life inevitably
brings in its train.</p>

<p>If the idea of life within the mother's womb is in this
<span class="sidenote">Life before
birth and life
after death</span>
way closely associated with the desire for cessation of toil and
striving, it is not surprising that we frequently find it brought
into connection with the most striking example of such cessation
with which we are acquainted, <em>i. e.</em> the complete stoppage of
all vital activities at death. As a matter of fact, the unconscious
identification of the state after death with the state before birth
would seem to be one of frequent and widespread occurrence,
the idea of the mysterious intra-uterine life before birth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
furnishing, through this identification, one of the causes of
belief in a continuance of life after death&mdash;life of a kind,
however, in which, as in the life before birth, all our desires
and needs are fulfilled without the necessity for toilsome and
unpleasant effort.</p>

<p>It is not only in our general attitude towards death that
the influence of this identification may be traced, but also in
many of the details as regards the beliefs and ceremonies
connected with the dead. The parallelism here referred to may
be seen for instance in the fact that we place our dead in
coffins and bury them in <em>graves</em> or <em>vaults</em> in <em>churches</em> (all of
which are womb symbols) or under the <em>earth</em> (itself among the
most frequent of mother symbols); or that in many places the
dead have been placed on small islands<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> caves, mountain tops,
or other secluded spots, or deposited (like King Arthur) in boats
and pushed out to sea. In this last practice we may probably
trace the influence of an identification of the <em>process</em> of death with
that of birth&mdash;the conception that at death we pass away by
the same road that we traversed when we entered into life at
birth<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>. For not only is the sea a frequent mother symbol, but
the idea of water is closely connected with that of birth, occurring
as it does in a great number of symbolic representations of the
latter<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>. A similar identification is chiefly responsible for the
belief that the dead pass across a lake or river on the way to
their new home. (<em>Cp.</em> Lethe, Styx and Acheron in classical
mythology or the river across which Christian passes to the
Celestial City in Pilgrim's progress).</p>

<p>The idea of birth or re-birth which we here meet with,
plays of itself, as we have already indicated, a part of very
<span class="sidenote">Birth
phantasies</span>
great importance in the unconscious mental life of many
individuals<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>, a part indeed sometimes of even greater significance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
than that of the idea of returning to the mother's womb, with
which it is so frequently associated. In its indirect (displaced)
representation in consciousness, this idea of birth or re-birth
will find expression as an emergence from any of the places
which serve as symbols for the womb&mdash;an island, grave, room,
church or other building, or again&mdash;and very typically&mdash;in the
process of forcing one's way through a tunnel, narrow passage,
staircase or other enclosed space, out into some relatively open
locality. More especially, however, is the idea connected in one
way or another with a passage through or out of water&mdash;a
pond, river, canal, lake or the sea. It is thus for instance that
it appears in a typical form of myth relating to the birth of
some heroic personage (<em>e. g.</em> Moses, Kama, Perseus, Romulus,
Siegfried, Lohengrin) in which the birth is symbolically
represented by the child's floating on the water in a cradle, boat
or basket<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>

<p>Birth phantasies of this kind are frequently accompanied
<span class="sidenote">Birth and fear</span>
by the idea of difficulty or danger and by a corresponding
emotion of fear. According to Freud<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>, the connection between
fear and the act of birth is a very intimate one; birth with its
attendant profound changes of physiological and environmental
conditions and its manifold dangers and discomforts, having
become, as it were, the prototype of all situations of a
threatening or disquieting character or in which life itself
appears to be menaced. Our word Anxiety&mdash;like the French
Angoisse, the German Angst, the Latin anxius, angere, angustus,
the Greek [Greek: anchô], all of which appear to be connected with the
Sanskrit anhus or anhas, signifying narrowness or constriction&mdash;bears
witness to the fundamental association of fear with
pressure and shortness of breath, which&mdash;the former owing to
the passage through the narrow vagina, the latter to the interruption
of the foetal circulation&mdash;constitute the most menacing
and terrifying aspects of the birth process.</p>

<p>If, and in so far as, the phantasy of re-entering the mother's
<span class="sidenote">The meaning
of the birth
phantasy</span>
womb represents a desire to escape from the difficulties and
trials of life into the condition of peace and protection which
the pre-natal period of life afforded, the idea of re-birth would
naturally seem to give expression to the tendency to emerge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>once more into the conflict of life and to emancipate oneself
from the protecting influence of the mother. Such a meaning
is indeed, as Jung<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and others<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> have shown, actually associated
with the phantasy in very many cases. In this sense, then, the
desire to attain to individual independence and freedom from
the parents finds symbolical representation as a repetition of
that process whereby we first acquired the status of an independent
organism distinct from that of the mother who
bore us.</p>

<p>In other cases however the symbolism is of a rather more
<span class="sidenote">Spiritual
regeneration</span>
remote kind, the idea symbolised being that of moral or spiritual
regeneration<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>. The reality of this significance of the re-birth
phantasy cannot well be doubted, being vouched for as it is
not only by the results of psycho-analytic enquiry but also by
the stereotyped phraseology of many religious formulae and by
the nature of many of the ceremonies connected with moral or
religious conversion. Thus the rite of baptism, as is pretty
generally recognised, consists, in one of its principal aspects, in
a symbolic representation of the act of birth, and the same is
true of many of the initiation ceremonies performed at puberty
in all parts of the world<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>.</p>

<p>The association&mdash;so often found in this connection&mdash;of re-birth
with a previous return to, and brief sojourn in, the
mother's womb, may be due perhaps to some extent to the
needs of logical consistency for, as Nicodemus said, a man
cannot literally "be born again" unless he has previously
"entered the second time into his mother's womb"; but probably
it has itself a further and deeper significance. As the
result of his researches upon this point, Jung<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> considers that
the association in question expresses the necessity of gathering
fresh sources of psychic energy from the deepest strata of our
mental life in the Unconscious, if the moral or spiritual conversion
is to be successful. Starting from the consideration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the products of the collective mind as exemplified in cult and
<span class="sidenote">Physical
regeneration</span>
legend rather than from the phantasies of the individual, other
investigators, such as Sir J. G. Frazer<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, have come to the conclusion
that it is primarily a physical rather than a moral
regeneration that is symbolised by the ideas of re-birth. Thus
the histories of such divine personages as Attis, Adonis or
Osiris, whose death and subsequent return to life are plainly
analogous to the phantasy of the return to the mother's womb
(burial in the earth) and re-birth from it, have been interpreted
as expressions of the desire for rejuvenation on the part of the
individual or the race, or again as representations (probably
magical in intention) of the periodical decay and revival of
vegetation or of the periodical changes of the seasons upon
which these depend. This view would seem to be supported
by the fact that such a significance (often however associated
with that of moral regeneration in Jung's sense) is inherent in
many of the mysteries and superstitions of all ages, as in the
ideas of the philosopher's stone or the elixir of life, and in the
symbolic practices, legends and traditions characteristic of secret
societies and of mysticism generally<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>.</p>

<p>All these interpretations are probably correct, so far as
<span class="sidenote">The literal
interpretation
of the womb
and birth
phantasies</span>
they go and as regards certain cases. Certainly the desire for
the preservation or recovery of youth, the attainment of immortality,
the ensuring of a good harvest or even the felt need
of spiritual regeneration are sufficiently strong and recurrent
motives of the human mind to justify their frequent appearance
in symbolic form. Nevertheless, from what we know of the
conditions governing the most deeply rooted and widespread
human phantasies and from the general laws which underlie
the use of symbolism<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>, it would seem likely that in a considerable
number of cases the meaning of the ideas of re-entering
the womb and of re-birth is not exhausted by these interpretations.
The frequency and relative uniformity of these womb
and birth phantasies make it probable that, in one of their
aspects at least, they are no mere symbols but represent things
actually desired on their own account. The actual return to
the womb does, as we have seen, represent the extreme expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
of the tendency to escape from the troubles of the
outer world to a condition in which there is complete immunity
from effort, responsibility, difficulty and danger. Further, psychoanalytic
<span class="sidenote">Sexual significance
of the
phantasies</span>
investigation of the womb and birth phantasies as they
occur in individuals seems to show that they often have a
<em>sexual</em> or quasi-sexual significance, being the expression of
sexual tendencies and arousing sexual feeling<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>. Through the
extreme intimacy which a child establishes with its mother by
the processes of gestation and birth, it may find in imagination by
means of these processes a not unsuitable method of gratifying
the sexual inclinations which it feels towards its mother; and
the phantasies of entering or emerging from the womb or
of being carried in it may thus come to take on a directly
sexual character, in the same way as any other of the numerous
activities or processes associated with erotic feeling. It is probable
too that in men and boys, the process of passing to or
from the womb through the vagina is treated, on the principle
of <em>totum pro parte</em>, as a substitute for the more directly sexual
act appropriate to later life&mdash;the individual having enjoyed, on
the occasion of his birth, the privilege of being in that place,
whence his incestuous desires impel him to return. In this sense
then, the womb and birth phantasies express the incestuous
tendencies in a milder and less objectionable form<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>In girls (or in boys, in so far as they possess homosexual
inclinations) the return to the mother may be used as a means
of attaining sexual intimacy with the father, indirectly through
fusion, or identification, with the mother<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.</p>

<p>The directly Sexual feeling thus attaching to these phantasies
<span class="sidenote">Sexual
curiosity</span>
is in many cases powerfully reinforced by the curiosity which
is experienced by children in relation to the processes of
conception, gestation and birth. Most children would seem to
possess at an early age a very lively interest in all matters
directly or indirectly connected with the reproductive function.
The question "Where do babies come from?" is one of the
most absorbing of all the problems of our early years; one
which, in its more sublimated forms, may lay the foundation
of that restless desire to know the causes and origins of things,
which is the driving force of much that is best in science
and philosophy; and one for which, in infancy and childhood,
a solution is sought in many of the childish theories of
reproduction which have recently attracted the attention of
psycho-analysts<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>.</p>

<p>Curiosity of this kind is also found to underlie much of
<span class="sidenote">Children's
questions</span>
that desire for knowledge which manifests itself in the incessant
asking of questions so characteristic of children at a certain
age. Where this is the case, the actual questions asked are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
often only substitutes for the real problem which so insistently
demands solution&mdash;the problem of the origin of men&mdash;and are
shown to be of little importance in themselves by the listless
and uninterested way in which the child frequently receives
the answers that are given him, making them, as he does only
too often, the starting point for fresh questions, the answers to
which prove in their turn to be equally unsatisfying. In all such
questioning the true nature of the real problem is for the most
part kept below the threshold of consciousness, through the
operation of repressive influences, originating perhaps to some
extent in the natural course of development of the child's own
mind, but probably to a greater degree due to the attitude
of his adult environment, which, directly or by implication, has
taught the child to regard such questions as taboo. This notion
<span class="sidenote">The forbidden
question in
myth and
legend</span>
of the question which is forbidden but which nevertheless
imperiously demands an answer is one that is of frequent
occurrence in myth and legend, the forbidden question often
disclosing itself as one which has reference to the birthplace,
parentage or birth of the hero (as for instance in the Lohengrin
legend) or the origin and nature of man in general (as in the
case of Œdipus)<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, it may well seem to the child
that his curiosity concerning the process by which he and
other children came into the world could be most satisfactorily
gratified by the experience in his own person of those events
concerning which information is required. The motive thus
aroused will then in many cases add very considerably to the
fascination which the ideas of gestation and birth may already
possess in virtue of their purely sexual significance. The desire
thus satisfied may again in some cases be still further reinforced
by the notion that the position of the child within the
womb is a favourable one for finding out many things about
the life of the mother and her relations to the father which
may be otherwise difficult to discover; as in the not infrequent
phantasy of observing the sexual act between the parents from
this point of vantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Summarising our discussion as to the significance of the
<span class="sidenote">Summary</span>
womb and birth phantasies, we have seen that they may have
any or all of the following meanings:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><em>As to the return to the womb</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) An expression of the tendency to withdraw from the labours
and difficulties of life to the place where the greatest possible
freedom from such troubles may be found; in which the
emphasis may be laid upon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) the desire for the effortless gratification of all needs and
wishes,</p>

<p>(b) the desire for protection from the dangers of the outer
world,</p>

<p>(c) the equation of life after death with life before birth, the
former being invested with all the supposed advantages
of the latter.</p></blockquote>

<p>(2) A sexual significance, as representing:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) the closest possible intimacy with the mother,</p>

<p>(b) a means of attaining sexual intimacy with the father
through fusion with the mother,</p>

<p>(c) a means of satisfying sexual curiosity.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>As to re-birth</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) A more or less symbolic significance; in which the emphasis
may be laid upon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) the desire for a more vigorous and independent mode
of life, involving greater freedom from the protecting and
guarding influence of the parents and especially of the
mother,</p>

<p>(b) the desire for physical rejuvenation (of the individual, of
the race, or of the means of subsistence),</p>

<p>(c) the desire for moral or religious improvement or conversion.</p></blockquote>

<p>(2) A more literal significance, in which the emphasis may be
laid upon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) a directly sexual pleasure in the contemplation of the
act, the process of birth being treated as a substitute for
sexual intercourse,</p>

<p>(b) the possibility of satisfying sexual curiosity<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>.</p></blockquote>

<br />
THE PSYCHOLOGY OF INITIATION<br />
AND INITIATION RITES</h2>


<p>The phantasies of return to the womb and of re-birth,
<span class="sidenote">The
psychological
significance
of initiation</span>
with which we have just been concerned, are intimately connected
with another phantasy which is met with surprisingly often in
the investigation of dreams and other manifestations of the
Unconscious&mdash;that of initiation. The idea of initiation corresponds
to a wish that is very deeply rooted in the human mind. In
the psycho-analytic study of individuals it is found perhaps
most frequently in the shape of a desire for sexual initiation
at the hands of the parents (or of obvious substitutes for these);
such initiation constituting (in the mind of the phantasy maker)
at once a removal of the prohibition which the parents had
formerly laid upon all manifestations of sexuality and an invitation
to penetrate those mysteries of sexual, reproductive and
adult life generally, which they have hitherto jealously guarded
for themselves.</p>

<p>It thus appears that in certain minds initiation is regarded
as a necessary preliminary to the exercise of the powers and
privileges of maturity in the sexual or in any other sphere of
life. At the same time, however, the phantasy of initiation is
often made the means of surreptitiously bringing about a
satisfaction of the old, prohibited, and largely superseded desires
of infancy. Thus there are frequently clear indications that it is not
only initiation into sex life in general that is required, but initiation
<span class="sidenote">Initiation and
Incest</span>
into the incestuous form of this life which was characteristic of the
first object-love of the child. Indeed the very persistence of these
infantile desires constitutes one of the principal motives of the
initiation phantasy; it is just the fact that all the sexual trends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
are to an appreciable extent still tinged with the atmosphere
of the repressed incestuous tendencies, which makes the removal
of the inhibitions and prohibitions attaching to these tendencies
to be felt as necessary, before sex life of any kind can be
enjoyed with freedom. Thus a boy may dream of "initiation"
at the hands of his father, because this signifies to him a
removal of the prohibition imposed by his father on all sexual
activity on the part of the boy&mdash;a prohibition imposed (as is
readily recognised by the Unconscious) in virtue of the boy's
original direction of his love towards the mother: without such
sign of approval and change of attitude on the father's part<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>,
the boy may feel that the original prohibition is still too powerful
to be overcome and that his sexual life will remain for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
ever under the ban of the strong inhibitions aroused by a sense
of parental disapproval<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>.</p>

<p>Similar considerations apply to the non-sexual aspects of
life, in which at maturity the youth takes his place as an equal
of the father, to whom he has hitherto looked up as a
superior.</p>

<p>The important and far-reaching changes in general conduct
<span class="sidenote">Initiation
ceremonies</span>
and, more particularly, in the attitude to be adopted toward the
elder members of an individual's own family, on the attainment
of full growth&mdash;involving as they do the overcoming of many
habits and inhibitions formed during the long period of human
infancy and childhood&mdash;are not of a kind to be accomplished
without difficulty and conflict. With a view to diminishing this
difficulty and to overcoming the conflict of motives which the
accomplishment of these changes necessarily involves, there
exists a well nigh universal tendency to endow the transition
from childhood to maturity with something of a solemn or
religious character, calculated at one and the same time to
reinforce the motives proper to maturity and to impress the
now full grown members of the community with the privileges
and responsibilities of their new condition. This tendency has
found definite and elaborate expression in the rites and
ceremonies of initiation which are to be found in societies of
every stage of culture and in every part of the world. These
ceremonies are of very considerable interest and importance
for our present purpose, for here, as so often elsewhere, the
results obtained from the study of racial and social customs
on the one hand and from the investigation of the unconscious
mental tendencies of the individual on the other, serve very
largely to amplify and corroborate one another, leading
ultimately to a degree of certainty and precision which it would
be difficult or impossible to attain by the pursuit of either
discipline alone.</p>

<p>Since the change from childhood to maturity involves readjustments
<span class="sidenote">Initiation and
re-birth</span>
of such a fundamental kind as to constitute to
some extent an entrance into a new phase of life, it is not
surprising that the initiation ceremony has often in one or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of its aspects taken the form of a symbolic process of re-birth;
the re-birth phantasy, as we have seen, being closely associated
with the idea of moral or spiritual conversion or regeneration.
The process of re-birth in these ceremonies may indeed on
occasion be represented by something actually approaching an
imitation of the act of birth, as in the case of the Kikuyu of
British East Africa, who "have a curious custom which requires
that every boy just before circumcision must be born again.
The mother stands up with the boy crouching at her feet, she
pretends to go through all the labour pains and the boy on
being reborn cries like a babe and is washed. He lives on milk
for some days afterwards<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>." Elsewhere the novice is swallowed
by a monster and again disgorged, thus simulating the return
to the womb and the re-birth therefrom<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. In still other cases
a drama of death and resurrection is enacted by the novices
or played before them<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>. Frequently an essential part of the
process of initiation consists of a more or less prolonged period
of seclusion about the time of puberty<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>; girls especially being
often confined in small huts for weeks, months or in some
cases years, at or before the time of their first menstruation<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>.</p>

<p>These initiatory rites would seem, like the womb and birth
<span class="sidenote">General and
sexual objects
in initiation</span>
phantasies which we have already studied, to have in the main
two principal objects in view; first, an introduction of the
initiated into the rights and responsibilities belonging to an
adult member of the community; secondly, an introduction into
sexual life.</p>

<p>As a means to the former end, the novice usually receives
instruction in the laws, customs, religious beliefs and ceremonial
practices of his tribe, or undergoes certain (often very severe)
trials of capacity and endurance with a view to ascertaining
his fitness to enter into the privileges of maturity.</p>

<p>On the sexual side the novice receives permission to marry
and generally to indulge his sexual tendencies (the process of
initiation being often succeeded by a period of unusual licence),
but at the same time is instructed in the numerous prohibitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and taboos as regards persons, circumstances and occasions
which are usually placed upon such indulgence.</p>

<p>Many of the details of these initiation ceremonies have,
<span class="sidenote">The abandonment
of infantile
tendencies
on the part of
the initiated</span>
directly or indirectly, reference to the emotional attitude of the
children towards their parents with which we have been concerned
in the earlier chapters of this book<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>. A general effort
to repress the mental attitude which the novice has at an
earlier period adopted towards his parents is to be observed
in the&mdash;real or feigned&mdash;amnesia<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> which so often occurs after
the initiation, the newly initiated sometimes failing to recognise
even their nearest relatives and being thus compelled to start
life with them on a new footing. The same tendency to break
loose from the old attitude is manifested in the actual separation
from the parents which seems always to take place at the
period of seclusion or at or before the ceremony of re-birth,
the affectionate farewell which is taken before such separation
(especially of the son from the mother) and in many of the
symbolic prohibitions of the period of seclusion, such as that
in virtue of which girls must, during their seclusion, neither
touch the earth (a universal mother symbol), nor be exposed to
the sun (an almost equally universal father symbol)<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>.</p>

<p>In the cruel rites which are so often inflicted on the novices
<span class="sidenote">The attitude of
the initiators
towards the
initiated</span>
by the elder members of the community it is possible to see
a manifestation of that fear and hatred which fathers often feel
towards their sons and which mothers often feel towards their
daughters&mdash;feelings which often correspond in nature and
intensity to the equivalent emotions in the children themselves
(<em>Cp.</em> below Ch. XIV); the pretended killing or death of the
novice being frequently of the nature of a punishment on the
talion principle for the thoughts of parricide or matricide
which the children may themselves have entertained towards
their parents. Before initiation youths are often not allowed
to carry arms, probably because of the fear that they may be
tempted to hurt or kill the father; sometimes, however, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
they can be admitted to the full privileges of maturity, they must
have killed a man&mdash;in order, probably, to work off their hostile
feelings on some third person who may serve as a substitute
for the father who was the original object of these feelings.</p>

<p>The hostile attitude of the older members of the community
towards the novices, which finds an outlet in the cruelties
practised at initiation, does not however spring exclusively
from sexual jealousy on the part of the elders, but also to
some extent from the disinclination which they feel to admitting
the youths&mdash;at any rate without some payment&mdash;into the
numerous secrets and privileges from which they have hitherto
excluded them, and from the general tendency to grudge the
abandonment of that superiority over the youths which they
themselves have hitherto enjoyed. The manifestation of these
feelings in some form of cruelty is most often rationalised as
a desire to prove that the novices are worthy of admission to
the privileges and responsibilities of the initiated and to ensure,
by adding to the impressiveness of the occasion, that they will
remember what they have seen and heard during the
initiation ceremonies<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>. Similar motives, leading to similar
manifestations, may often be observed even in highly civilised
communities, where the initiation is usually one destined to
introduce the individual not into adult life in general but into
some special class, institution or society, or into some corporate
body consisting of persons who have enjoyed some special
kind of experience or mode of life. Under this head, for
instance, come many of the time honoured customs and
ceremonies, to which boys on entering school or joining a
"gang", students on going to college, or persons joining some
professional society or guild, are made to submit<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>In other aspects of the ceremonies, however, the motive
of sexual jealousy stands unmistakably displayed. Thus the
rites of circumcision and subincision, the pulling out of hairs
from the head, face or pubic region and the knocking out of
teeth, which so frequently precede or accompany the process
of initiation, are all symbols of castration; a penalty which
it is desired to inflict&mdash;really or symbolically&mdash;from a
number of distinct though closely connected motives, the most
important being:&mdash;(1) as a means of rendering impossible the
realisation of forbidden sexual cravings, (2) as a threat to show
that the power of the elders still exists and that it will be
exercised should the prescribed limits be overstepped, (3) as
a punishment for past incestuous desires or acts (as is shown,
for instance, in the superstition that if the wound caused by
circumcision does not readily heal it is because the youth has
already been guilty of incestuous connection<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>). The same object
of preventing incest is sought in the stern "avoidances" which
<span class="sidenote">Prohibition
and licence</span>
are often practised at the same time; as, for instance, that by
which a youth must keep very carefully from all contact with
his mother, even to the extent of avoiding her footprints.</p>

<p>But if all love in the old direction is forbidden, sexual
activity in other directions is often encouraged as a substitute,
as in such instructions as the following: "Thou, my pupil, art
now circumcised. Thy father and thy mother, honour them. Go
not unannounced into their house, lest thou find them together
in tender embrace. But have no fear of maidens; sleep and
bathe together with them"<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>. Even so, however, there usually
remain, as we might expect from the general nature of displacement,
some remnants of the old incestuous fixation; such
as those, for instance, which manifest themselves in the belief
that after the first sexual connection of a youth, either he himself
or his partner in the act must shortly die (as a punishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
we must suppose, for the sin committed)&mdash;a belief which
leads young men to fall upon and have forcible intercourse
with <em>old</em> women (mother substitutes)<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>. Here the youth is
definitely permitted some degree of (symbolic) incestuous
indulgence before he finally abandons his infantile desires. A
still wider permission of the same kind is, however, granted
in the fairly widespread practice of removing the usual sexual
taboos on all or most of the prohibited persons during "the
period of revelry which follows initiation, where the nearest
relationships&mdash;even those of own brother and sister&mdash;seem to
be no bar to the general licence," even though shortly afterwards
these same "brothers and sisters may not so much as
speak to one another".<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The monster from whose belly the novices are reborn
<span class="sidenote">Re-birth and
Reconciliation</span>
would appear in many cases to represent the young men's
grandfather, through him their dead ancestors and ultimately
the ancestral founder of the tribe. This rather astonishing fact
as regards the supposed sex of the monster is probably due
in the first place to a psychic identification of the child with
his grandfather&mdash;an identification of very frequent occurrence
and considerable significance, the psychological foundations of
which can however be more appropriately discussed in a later
chapter. (Ch. XIV). The novice in being born from the body
of the grandfather becomes in a sense a re-incarnation of
the grandfather and is endowed with all his powers and
attributes.</p>

<p>In a secondary and "rationalised" sense, this process of
re-birth from the grandfather has been interpreted as the
expression of a desire to re-create the youth as the son of his
tribe rather than as the son of his mother, <em>i. e.</em> to symbolise
and emphasise the fact that he has now exchanged the narrow
sphere of family rule and affection for the wider one of
obedience and loyalty to the community; at the same time
representing a means of obtaining freedom from the old fixation
of love upon the mother (since he is now born not from her
but from the tribal ancestor), and through this of becoming
reconciled to the father. This same motive of reconciliation
based on the renunciation of incestuous desire and on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
establishment of common love and interest between those of
the same sex, is exemplified also in the Age Classes, Men's
Clubs and Secret Societies found in so many primitive peoples,
to membership of which women are in the majority of cases
rigorously excluded.</p>

<p>Thus it would appear that the ideas underlying the almost
universal social custom of the initiation ceremony are those
which we have already met with in the study of the development
of the individual mind in relation to the family: showing thereby
that these ideas are to be found not only in minds of a certain
constitution or of a particular age, race, or type of culture, but
represent a general human characteristic, having its foundations
deeply rooted in the history of mankind; a part of our mental
inheritance which has to be reckoned with in all efforts at
social or individual improvement, a factor for good or evil
which education, instruction or upbringing may perhaps modify
but can scarcely hope to eradicate.</p>

<br />
THE DEVELOPMENT OF PARENT SUBSTITUTES</h2>


<p>Our last two chapters have again been something in the
nature of a digression&mdash;a digression however which, we will
hope, has not been altogether unprofitable, inasmuch as it has
opened to our view some of the wider aspects of our problem,
and afforded us a glimpse of the extent to which the aspects
of family life which are forcing themselves on the attention of
psychologists at the present day, are the same as those which
have exercised the greatest influence upon mankind in all
places and of all degrees of culture, and have manifested
themselves everywhere in human beliefs and institutions. It
is now time, however, to resume our previous problem&mdash;the
study of the influence of the family upon the development
of the individual in its more remote, indirect and abnormal
aspects.</p>

<p>In the failures and abnormalities of development with which
<span class="sidenote">Varieties and
abnormalities
as regards the
displacement
of parent-regarding
tendencies</span>
we were concerned in Chapters VI and VII, the principal
characteristic was the persistence of, or return to, an infantile
or childlike relationship towards the <em>parents</em>. In normal
development, as we have seen, this relationship is outgrown
largely by the help of the mechanism of Displacement, in virtue
of which the emotional attitude towards the parents is transferred
to other persons, who (at any rate in the early stages
of the process) are connected with the parents by some
associative link. Supposing development to have proceeded
normally along these lines for a certain period, it is still possible
for an arrest or regression to occur, as a result of which any
of these later stages may become permanent instead of transitory,
in precisely the same manner as in the case of the earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
stages in which the emotions and feelings are still directly
related to the parents themselves.</p>

<p>From one point of view abnormalities occurring in these
later stages are perhaps less serious than those which we
considered in the earlier chapters, inasmuch as the regression
is less complete; some degree of psychical emancipation from
the parents being still preserved. Nevertheless these abnormalities
may constitute a very grave hindrance to the general development
and mental health of the individual and, in the case of the
displacement of very intense affects, may give rise to consequences
of a distinctly pathological order; while, on their more sublimated
side, they have contributed much to some of the most important
aspects of social life and culture.</p>

<p>We have already in Chapter III studied some of the ways in
<span class="sidenote">Insufficient
Displacement</span>
which the displacement of the original love from parents to
other persons takes place. If the displacement remains at a
stage in which the associative link between the original and
the later object of love is a very firm or close one, we may
say that the development is incomplete, inasmuch as the
individual's love is still to an undue extent on an infantile
fixation. Of the various associative links which we have
enumerated as being those of most frequent occurrence&mdash;mental
or physical characteristics, age, circumstances of life, past history,
family relationship etc., the last named is apt to play an
especially important part in cases of arrested or regressive
development. The displacement of love from parent to brother
or sister may probably, as we have seen, be regarded as a
<span class="sidenote">Displacement

relationship<br />
<br />
Brother and
sister</span>
normal transitory phase. The intensity of the attachment
frequently aroused and the sexual nature which it often retains
in the Unconscious right on into adolescent and adult life are
vouched for, on the negative side, by the strength of the
repressions raised against incestuous tendencies of this kind&mdash;repressions
which are scarcely less severe than those directed
against parent incest. Similarly, on the positive side, the true
nature of the brother-sister relationship is often startlingly
revealed by the process of psycho-analysis and is also shown
by the study of legend, of literature and of the habits and
customs of primitive peoples.</p>

<p>We have already seen (p. 86) that on occasions of special
licence connection between brother and sister, though otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
strictly tabooed, may be temporarily permitted. It seems to be
<span class="sidenote">Cases where
brother-sister
incest has been
permitted</span>
pretty generally agreed among anthropologists that these
occasions are of the nature of reversions to a condition of
affairs that was once comparatively frequent, if not indeed quite
general<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>. There are in fact numerous indications that such
brother-sister connections were, among certain peoples at any
rate, the rule rather than the exception. H. L. Morgan, to whose
credit lies the discovery of the so-called classificatory system
of relationship, thinks indeed that a group marriage between
own brothers and sisters was the earliest kind of restriction
upon absolute promiscuity and constituted the basis of the
oldest form of the human family<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>. The evidence for the really
primitive character of any such family has been seriously disputed
in more recent writings<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>; but the frequent occurrence of
temporary or permanent brother-sister unions among both
primitive and more advanced peoples would seem to be beyond
dispute. Thus the incest of brother and sister is said to be, or
to have been, common among the Antambahoaka of South East
Madagascar<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>, among many tribes of Brazil<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>, in Cali<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> (Colombia),
Tenasserim<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> (Burma), Mexico<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and many other places. The
ancient Persians seem to have permitted incest of this kind,
though Herodotus remarks with reference to the marriage of
Cambyses to his sister that this was not a usual procedure<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>.
In Egypt, however, such connections were not only admitted
but approved, marriage between brother and sister being there
regarded as the "best of marriages" and acquiring "an
ineffable degree of sanctity when the brother and sister who
contracted it were themselves born of a brother and sister,
who had in their turn also sprung from a union of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
sort"<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>. Even in Greece a similar practice does not seem to have
been unusual, for, if we may believe Cornelius Nepos<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, no disgrace
attached to Cimon's marriage with his sister Elpinice,
since his fellow-citizens had the same custom. Among the Jews
too, the prophet Ezekiel<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> complains of the occurrence of this
form of incest. Primitive customs, it is now generally agreed,
are apt to persist in the case of royal families long after they
have ceased to be observed by the common people; and the
persistent brother and sister marriages among the Ptolemies
of Egypt and the Incas of Peru, as well as the existence of
similar practices among reigning families in primitive peoples
of recent times<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>, afford further evidence of the former widespread
occurrence of brother-sister unions.</p>

<p>On the negative side too, there is evidence to be gained
<span class="sidenote">Repression of,
and desire for
such incest</span>
from the nature of the taboos and institutions erected against
incest. According to Frazer<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> the exogamous systems of the
Australian aborigines seem to have originated in the first place
as a means of preventing connections between brother and
sister, the prohibition of marriage between other relatives
having been brought about by subsequent developments and
elaborations of the primitive two class system, instituted for
the purpose of avoiding brother-sister marriages. The abhorrence
of brother-sister incest is indeed very marked in many
primitive communities, and that this abhorrence represents the
repression of a genuine desire for incest of this kind is shown
by the remarks of travellers that the "avoidances" and other
methods of enforcing the prohibitions are often "very
necessary"<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> and by the fact, already referred to, that as soon
as the customary restrictions are relaxed, the otherwise forbidden
connections are freely indulged in. To this evidence
from anthropology there might be added the scarcely less convincing
data from mythology and literature, which has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
studied in such detail by Rank<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and which perhaps, for this
reason, we need not stop to dwell on here; it being sufficient
to remind the reader in passing of such well known mythological
cases as the unions of Zeus and Hera and of Osiris
and Isis, or, as regards literature, to refer him to such recent
examples as Artzibasheff's "Sanine" or d'Annunzio's "City of
the Dead" where the existence of erotic feeling between
brother and sister is treated in an open manner.</p>

<p>As a further stage of development the original parent
<span class="sidenote">Displacement
of parent&mdash;regarding
tendencies on
to more distant
relatives</span>
love may be displaced, not on to a brother or sister, but on
to some more distant relative, such as a cousin (a brother or
sister substitute) or an uncle or aunt (more directly parent
substitutes)<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>. Cousin marriage is, among ourselves, passing
through the stage of being legally permissible though still
regarded with some degree of moral disapproval or suspicion.
In other times and places it has, like brother-sister marriage,
been the object both of sternest prohibition<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> and of warm
approval<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>. Any kind of sexual relationship between nephews
and aunts or between nieces and uncles seems to have been,
too, reminiscent of the repressed tendencies to parent-incest to
have received sanction either legally or morally, but unions of
this kind have nevertheless sometimes been found among primitive
peoples<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>, and are not infrequently present as objects
of desire in the unconscious mind of those who live in civilised
communities to-day.</p>

<p>Of particular interest in this connection is the displacement
<span class="sidenote">Relatives by
marriage</span>
of feelings originally directed to the parents towards <em>relatives
in law.</em> Since by marriage one partner in the marriage is
supposed to have entered into the family of the other, and,
in virtue of the partial identification of the two partners through
common ties of interest and affection, may really be said to
have in some measure effected such an entrance, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
altogether surprising to find much the same conflict of tendencies
centering about the new relatives acquired by marriage
as that which formerly centred round the relatives by blood.
Thus on the one hand we find among primitive peoples the
same taboos and avoidances practised in the one case as in
the other. In some places, for instance, a man may have no
dealings with some or all of the members of his wife's family,
nor a wife with those of her husband's<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>. On the other hand
a number of practices indicate that connections of an intimate
kind between relatives by marriage are, under certain circumstances
at any rate, regarded as permissible and appropriate.
Such, for instance, is the widespread custom of the Levirate<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>,
whereby a man is expected to take unto himself his deceased
brother's wife or the scarcely less frequent usage of the
Sororate<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> whereby a man marries his deceased wife's sister&mdash;practices
which seem to have made their influence felt
(negatively) in our own table of relatives with whom wedlock
is forbidden, including, as this does, not only blood relatives
but relatives by marriage<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>.</p>

<p>In recent times the relationship by marriage which has
<span class="sidenote">Parent-in-law
and
child-in-law</span>
attracted most attention is that of parent-in-law and child-in-law.
In view of the complex nature of the relations between
parent and child and of the elaborate process of re-adjustment
in these relations which takes place in the course of normal
development, it is only to be expected that, when a person
suddenly acquires, as it were, new parents by the act of marriage,
he should experience some difficulty in establishing a
satisfactory relationship with these new parents, with whom,
unlike his own original parents, he may have had but little
<span class="sidenote">Difficulties
caused by
parent fixation
on the part of
husband or
wife</span>
time or opportunity to grow acquainted. To this general cause
tending to make the relationship between children-in-law and
parents-in-law one of difficulty, there are often added at least
three further special sources of embarrassment, to the consideration
of which we may perhaps profitably devote a few
words here. In the first place, husbands and wives are not
free to adjust their relations to their parents-in-law according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to the inclinations of the two parties directly concerned, but
must (if they are to be successful) also bring these relations
into some degree of harmony with those of their partners in
marriage towards these same parents (in this case parents by
blood): this is often far from easy, especially if, as so often
happens, either husband or wife or both have not entirely
freed themselves from their original infantile attitude towards
their parents. Thus let us suppose that a young woman at the
time of her marriage still retains a large amount of veneration
and (unconscious) love towards her father. This may cause
her even after marriage to look to her father rather than her
husband as the source of her ideals and aspirations, to mould
her life according to his, rather than her husband's, precept
and example, and generally to adopt an attitude towards her
father, which her husband (who does not altogether share
her&mdash;probably exaggerated&mdash;views as to her father's admirable
qualities) can scarcely be expected to imitate or to approve.
A very similar difficulty may be brought about in the case of
daughter-in-law and mother-in-law, where a son has retained
an unduly infantile attitude towards his mother; while in still
other cases the trouble may be due to an exaggerated
dependence of husband or wife upon the parent of his or her
own sex, <em>i. e.</em>, the husband upon his father, or the wife upon
her mother respectively. It is obvious that a fixation of this
kind on the side of either partner in a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'marrage'">marriage</ins> may (quite
apart from its influence on the harmony of the marriage itself)
be sufficient to bring about a very considerable degree of
difficulty in the relationship between one partner and the
parents of the other.</p>

<p>This tendency is moreover liable to be largely reinforced&mdash;or
<span class="sidenote">The displacement
of affect
from parents
to parents-in-law</span>
at least complicated&mdash;by the other factors to which
we referred above. The second of these sources of difficulty
(the one which is indeed most intimately connected with our
present line of thought) lies in the fact that the child-in-law
himself is frequently unable to regard his parents-in-law with
impartial eyes, but transfers to them some of the feelings of
love or of hatred which he originally directed towards his own
parents. This is perhaps most often and most openly manifest
in the case of hostile emotions; men or women expressing
relatively freely towards a father-in-law or mother-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
respectively those feelings of hatred which they had felt (but
<span class="sidenote">Hate</span>
had perhaps repressed) with reference to the corresponding
parents by blood. The natural identification of their parents-in-law
with their own parents, in virtue of which this displacement
of affect is enabled to take place, is often facilitated by
the operation of the factor we have already considered&mdash;a
parent fixation in the case of the other partner to the marriage.
Where such a fixation exists, a father-in-law or mother-in-law
may be felt to be in some sort a sexual rival, in very much
the same way as was at one time the original parent (p. 17).
Thus (to return to the example that we just now used) a
husband may feel that his father-in-law unduly influences his
wife and absorbs much of her affection and interest to the
detriment of that devoted to himself: this recalls the earlier
situation in which a similar rival&mdash;his own father&mdash;exercised
a similar influence over the then object of his affection, his
own mother; and as a result of an unconscious identification
of the new situation with the old, the hostile feeling originally
directed towards his own father may be re-awakened and
transferred to the father-in-law. In this way the feeling of
enmity directed towards the latter may be more intense than
that which would be really appropriate to the situation. Any
recently aroused (and perhaps to some extent legitimate) feeling
of annoyance is reinforced by the emotions set free by the
stirring up of the still powerful parent complexes of infancy
and childhood.</p>

<p>Less liable to open manifestation is the corresponding
<span class="sidenote">Love</span>
transfer of affect from parent to parent-in-law where the
emotion concerned is love rather than hatred. Such a transfer
may nevertheless occur in certain circumstances. In a positive
form it may result in a high degree of veneration or affection
for the parents-in-law (or one of them), which&mdash;especially if
it should coincide with a high degree of parent love in the
other partner to the marriage&mdash;may lead to the existence of
very friendly and intimate relations of the younger couple with
the elder; relations which may, however, in many cases,
tend to undermine the initiative and independence of the
younger pair. In a negative form (which is very liable to occur,
since the vigorous repression of the original incestuous thoughts
very easily extends to any fresh tendencies calculated to arouse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
them) a transfer of this kind may lead to frequent troubles,
misunderstandings and frictions between the child-in-law and
parent-in-law whom it concerns.</p>

<p>The third and last of our three factors which complicate
<span class="sidenote">Corresponding
displacement
on the part of
the parents-in-law
themselves</span>
the relations of children-in-law and parents-in-law consists in a
similar displacement of affect on the part of the parents-in-law,
in virtue of which they may direct towards their
children by marriage the affection or hostility which they
originally experienced in relation to their own children; a
factor the significance of which may perhaps be more fully and
easily appreciated after we have discussed the intimate nature
of these original feelings of parents to their own children
(<em>cp.</em> Ch. XIV below), and with regard to which perhaps it is
therefore best to content ourselves with a mere passing
reference here.</p>

<p>The relation between child-in-law and parent-in-law which
<span class="sidenote">Son-in-law and
Mother-in-law</span>
has become notoriously the most difficult in recent times is
that of son-in-law and mother-in-law. This relation too has
been made the object of some special study by psycho-analysts<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>,
who have found in it all the factors which we have referred
to above. Among the most important grounds for the hostility
which so often marks this relationship have been observed
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The conflict between the mother and the husband for
the possession of the daughter and her belongings. The mother
having in the majority of cases in the past enjoyed a greater
or less degree of authority over the daughter, is loth to abandon
this source of power, and seeks to retain it by exercising
(through the frequent giving of advice, appeal to her own
greater experience or otherwise) some sort of control over
the daughter's household or mode of life. This interference on
the part of the mother-in-law in the domestic arrangements of
the younger couple is very apt to be resented by the son-in-law,
either directly, because it appears to threaten his own
supreme control over his own family, or indirectly, because he
identifies himself with the daughter (his wife) who in her turn
may not unnaturally object to the continuance of maternal
supervision after her marriage. On the other hand, should the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
daughter display a marked tendency to be influenced by her
mother or a high degree of veneration or affection for her,
the son-in-law will again resent the interference of the latter,
as threatening an encroachment on his wife's love and
respect towards himself.</p>

<p>2. The husband's fear of losing (through too intimate
contact with his mother-in-law) the sense of sexual attractiveness
which his wife possesses for him. The mother-in-law reminds
him of his wife, but is without her youthful beauty and this
is apt to produce in him a dim sense of apprehension lest, as
a result of seeing, as it were, the mother in the daughter, and
of vaguely realising that the daughter may one day come to
resemble the mother, the former may lose for him her charm
and his whole marriage become thereby distasteful.</p>

<p>Of these two motives tending to produce disagreement
between mother-in-law and son-in-law, the first is for the most
part situated at or near the surface of consciousness, while
the second can in many cases be brought to consciousness by
the exercise of a little courageous introspection. Both motives,
however (especially the second), are liable to be reinforced by
two further motives, which remain for the most part buried in
the Unconscious.</p>

<p>3. The mother-in-law may re-awaken in the son-in-law, in
the manner we have already indicated, feelings which are
incestuous in origin, being a displacement of those originally
directed towards his own mother; the repression of these
feelings of affection then giving place to their opposite&mdash;a
feeling of repulsion or hostility&mdash;as a means of preventing the
irruption into consciousness of the tabooed incestuous desires.
As some indication of the reality of this factor, apart from the
results of psycho-analysis, may be mentioned the fairly well
recognised facts that it is possible for a man to be attracted
to his future mother-in-law before he falls in love with his
future wife, that he may hesitate as to whether he shall marry
mother or daughter, or that he may fall back upon the mother
should the daughter die or fail him in some other way. As
further evidence too&mdash;on the negative side&mdash;we may refer to
the extraordinarily numerous and widespread taboos and
"avoidances" which affect the relations between son-in-law and
mother-in-law among primitive peoples.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>4. A corresponding displacement of incestuous desires,
leading to a similar repression and reversal of emotion, may
occur in the case of the mother-in-law herself, who, in virtue of
this displacement, identifies her son-in-law with a son of her
own (either real or imaginary); the one re-awakening in her
incestuous tendencies originally aroused in connection with the
other. Or again, the primary motive on the part of the mother-in-law
may be unconscious sexual jealousy of her daughter, to
whom she grudges the superior attractiveness of youth and
the pleasures of dawning sexual life&mdash;a life which for the
mother may be largely or entirely at an end. In this case she
may unconsciously identify herself with her daughter, imagining,
as it were, that it is she herself, and not her daughter, that
is married to her son-in-law. In either case it is often the less
tender and more sadistic elements of the mother-in-law's love
which are directed to the son-in-law, since these are more
easily reconciled with the maintenance of the requisite degree
of repression than would be the case with the more gentle
and affectionate components.</p>

<p>Only less important than the relations of child-in-law and
<span class="sidenote">Step-child and
Step-parent</span>
parent-in-law are those of step-child and step-parent<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>; and such
lesser degree of importance as these have is due rather to the
lesser frequency of their occurrence than to any lesser significance
which they possess for the individuals actually concerned.
The generally outstanding feature of these relations is the
manifestation of a more intense, or at any rate a more open,
form of those feelings and tendencies which would normally
exist between the child and the corresponding blood parent.
A boy, for instance, who may successfully have displaced or
repressed his original feelings of jealousy or hostility towards
his own father, may often prove incapable of carrying out a
similar re-adjustment in the case of a subsequently acquired
step-father. The latter may have none of the glamour which
belonged to the former in virtue of his position as head of the
family (and therefore centre of the child's world) during the
infancy of the child (<em>cp.</em> p. 55) and which may have helped to
inhibit the original hostility experienced towards him through
arousal of the opposite emotions of love, gratitude or admiration.
The step-father, therefore, may easily re-awaken in his step-son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
any remnants of the hatred which the latter may have experienced
towards his real father, without re-awakening in
corresponding degree the compensating forces which kept the
hate in check.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the boy's mother only marries the step-father
after a period of widowhood during which the boy may have
appeared to possess the sole, or at any rate the chief, claim
upon her interest and affection. By her re-marriage she will
probably seem to the boy's unconscious mind to have been,
in a very real and poignant sense, unfaithful to himself, and
to have rejected his own love for that of an outsider; an idea
which may appear in consciousness in the rationalised form of
an imputation of unfaithfulness towards the mother's previous
husband&mdash;the boy's own father. It is a complex of feelings of
this kind which, as Ernest Jones<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> has so convincingly shown,
underlies and forms the principal psychological motive in
<span class="sidenote">"Hamlet" as a
study of this
relationship</span>
Shakespeare's tragedy of "Hamlet". It is this which is the cause
of Hamlet's vacillation in regard to the contemplated murder
of his step-father; the latter had only done what Hamlet himself
would fain have done before him, but was inhibited from
doing. The contemplation of Claudius's ill deeds serves dimly
to call up the buried tendencies which at one time prompted
Hamlet himself to commit a similar atrocity&mdash;the murder of
the king (his father)&mdash;for a similar end&mdash;the possession of the
queen (his mother)&mdash;and the paralysing effect of the arousal
of such feelings makes itself felt as an inability to carry out
the punishment of one with whom he thus has much in
common, and whom he feels to be in a sense no worse than
himself, the would-be punisher. Moreover, in virtue of his
marriage with the queen, Claudius now really stands in the
old king's place; in killing him, therefore, Hamlet is to his
own unconscious mind becoming guilty of the very crime of
Œdipus which had tempted him before his father's death;
hence the resistance to the consummation of the act which
hatred of the interloper prompts him to perform.</p>

<p>In the case of a girl, corresponding feelings may be called
<span class="sidenote">The wicked
step-mother in
fairy tales</span>
up towards her step-mother on the re-marriage of her father&mdash;feelings
which have found expression in the very numerous
and familiar myths and fairy tales (such as those of Cinderella,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Snow White, Mother Holle), of the wicked step-mother who
kills, beats, neglects, falsely accuses, drives out or otherwise
ill-treats her step-daughter<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. Here the feelings of the girl, like
those of the boy under similar circumstances, are given free
vent towards the step-mother, where they were formerly
inhibited by emotions of an opposite character (or at least
repressed by considerations of general or traditional morality)
in the case of the girl's true mother; the step-mother thus
serving as an object capable at once of arousing, and of
becoming the recipient of, hostile and jealous feelings, which
had hitherto successfully been held in check.</p>

<p>These feelings of hostility on the part of children to their
<span class="sidenote">The attitude of
step-parents
towards their
step-children</span>
step-parents are of course bound to call up some degree of
reciprocal feeling on the part of the step-parents themselves.
The feelings thus aroused, however, are often reinforced by
more direct causes of hostility, such as are liable to affect in
any case the attitude of parent towards child (<em>Cp.</em> Ch. XVI).
Here, however, the absence of the real bond of parenthood,
with its accompanying incentives to tender feeling, may easily
cause the hostile tendencies to meet with less resistance than
usual so that genuinely cruel or neglectful behaviour is more
likely to occur.</p>

<p>Although it is the displacement of hate which manifests
<span class="sidenote">The displacement
of love
on to
step-parents</span>
itself most openly and strongly in the relations of step-children
to step-parents, the displacement of love from the original dead
parent to the new parent may also play an important (though
nearly always more or less unconscious) part in these
relations<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. The taboo on incest works less powerfully in regard
to the feelings towards the new parent than it did in regard
to those towards the old. The new parent is, as a rule, no
relative by blood, nor is the surviving real parent felt to have
the same exclusive rights over his or her new partner as over
the old; therefore the step-parent, when of the opposite sex
to that of the child, is often made the object of a displacement
of those feelings of tenderness and love which were formerly
directed to the real parent of this sex; this state of affairs
leading of course in the majority of cases to a corresponding
re-awakening of jealousy or bitterness towards the surviving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
original parent. This love of step-child to step-parent (and
particularly that of step-son to step-mother) and the contest
between both of these and the remaining parent, is one which
has indeed been used for ages as a mild form of displacement
of the tendencies and affects originally aroused when both the
child's parents were alive, and one which has found very
frequent expression in myth, legend and literature<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>.</p>

<p>All that we have here said as regards the feelings of
<span class="sidenote">Re-marriage
after divorce</span>
children to their step-parents holds good to an even greater
extent than usual in the case of the re-marriage of parents
after a divorce or on their acquiring a fresh sexual partner
after separation from their lawful husband or wife. Here indeed
the feelings and emotions aroused are apt to be still further
intensified by the fact that the children have been, in the nature
of the case, more or less compelled to take sides in the previous
struggle or disagreement that has taken place between the
parents. A child's feelings of love and hate towards his parents
are usually intensely stirred by all manifestations on their part
of conjugal unhappiness or infidelity and when the barriers
which prevent the full expression of these feelings towards the
child's real parents are removed by the substitution of a step-parent,
this new parent will often receive the full force of the
love or hate which had hitherto been pent up.</p>

<p>In this chapter we have been concerned with the displacement
of the parent-regarding emotions and tendencies on
to persons who resemble the parents in that they are connected
with the child by some close tie of family relationship. In the
next chapter we shall proceed to discuss some of the other
associative mechanisms through the operation of which this
displacement may be effected.</p>

FAMILY INFLUENCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE<br />
LOVE LIFE</h2>


<p>When the original object-love, at first directed to the
<span class="sidenote">The more advanced
stages
of love displacement</span>
parent, has been <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'successfuly'">successfully</ins> transferred to some more remote
relative in the manner studied in the last chapter, the course
of normal development now requires that a further transference
should take place by means of a similarity or association of
some kind between this latter relative and some other person
totally unconnected by family relationship. In consequence it is
often possible to trace in the selection of the object of love
the influence of similarity, or of some other connecting link,
between this object and the lover's sister, brother, cousin or
other relative. Here, however, the emancipation from the original
object is carried too far for the underlying motive determining
the direction of affection to be regarded as in any sense
pathological or abnormal or as indicating an undue degree of
fixation at an infantile stage of development; except in cases
where this motive is so strong as to bring about the direction
of love upon an object which is totally unsuitable, through the
overlooking of defects which would otherwise be patent. Rather
is this act of transference, when free from any such exaggeration,
to be looked upon as the final stage of the whole process of
development we have been following and as an indication of the
attainment of maturity as regards the direction of the love
impulse.</p>

<p>The importance of the displacement here at work will be
<span class="sidenote">"Falling in
love"</span>
more readily grasped, if we bear in mind that it constitutes
one of the principal factors in the normal and all-important
process of "falling in love," and particularly of that most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
striking but at the same time most mystifying aspect of that
process which we call "love at first sight." Love and its causes
have ever raised the wonder and curiosity both of the plain
man and of the philosopher, but, apart from more or less
unsatisfactory theory and vague speculation, neither has been
able to bring forward any explanation of the sudden over-powering
attraction which a young man or woman, boy or
girl, may feel for some one member of the opposite sex; one
whose charms may appear to more unbiassed eyes to be but
little if at all superior to those of others of the loved one's
age and situation. Thanks however to the work of the
psycho-analytic school, psychology is at last beginning to cast
a few rays of light upon the darkness which has hitherto
surrounded this central problem of human life and feeling.
Freud, in a recent article<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> summarizing the results of psycho-analysis
in this direction, has divided loves into two main
<span class="sidenote">Two types of
love:&mdash;</span>
types:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) the narcissistic type,</p>

<p>(2) the dependence type.</p>

<p>In the first type the love is the result of a projection of
<span class="sidenote">The
narcissistic
type</span>
the lover's self on to some other person&mdash;the narcissistic love
originally directed to the Self being thus displaced on to the
person of the loved one&mdash;through some process of identification
or some strong associative link. Love of this type is frequently
manifested in ties of a homosexual nature, where the lover
finds in one of his own sex a nearer copy of himself than
would otherwise be possible. It is also manifested in some of
the fervent affections of parents for their children, where the
parents regard those whom they have produced as in a manner
an extension of themselves (<em>cp.</em> below Ch. XIV). And finally it
is manifested in some connections of a normal heterosexual
kind; a man for example finds and admires in his wife those
feminine qualities which are present in himself but to which,
so long as they are in himself, he is unable (owing to repression
of the feminine side of his nature) to afford full recognition
or appreciation; or a woman finds attractive in a man those
qualities of boyishness and masculinity which she herself
possessed in some degree before the time of puberty but which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
she has since sacrificed to make way for a more pronounced
development of her "womanly" characteristics.</p>

<p>In love of the second type the affection is more genuinely
<span class="sidenote">The dependence
type</span>
and primarily "object-love." The lover is here attracted towards
his object because he finds in it something that is essential to
the fulfilment of his own bodily or mental needs. It is this
love which, as we have seen, is under normal circumstances
first aroused in connection with the parents (and especially
the mother), by whom the first primitive requirements of the
infant are fulfilled. It is this love too which, in its displaced
form, we have seen to be so frequently directed on to brothers,
sisters or other near relatives, and which, by a further process
of displacement, in the course of normal development eventually
flows on to persons unconnected with the lover by any bond
of relationship. The repression, as a result of which this latter
displacement has occurred, as a rule, brings it about that
the associative links that connect the newer with the older
love are not perceptible to the lover himself; the bond is an
unconscious one. Nevertheless, this bond is often sufficiently
clear to any keen observer, whose eyes have once been
opened to the fact of its existence. In other cases however
it may be of a more obscure nature, so as to require a deeper
study of the personality of the lover and of his psychological
history (such as can often only be obtained by employment of
the psycho-analytic method) before the nature of the association
becomes apparent.</p>

<p>The fact that in the personality of the loved object there
<span class="sidenote">The repression
of the incestuous
basis of
affection, as
shown in myth
and legend</span>
often lies hidden, as it were, the buried image of a brother,
sister, parent or other object of incestuous affection in the past,
would seem to play an important part in the formation of a
type of story of world-wide occurrence, of which the Cupid-Psyche
myth and the Lohengrin legend are perhaps the best
known examples<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>. In these stories a marriage or love affair
takes place between partners, one of whom is usually of
mysterious (sometimes divine) origin and consents to enter
upon the alliance only upon the condition that no question
shall be asked as to his (or her) name, parentage or home; or
upon the erection of some other prohibition, such as one which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
forbids the use of vision or of speech (either generally or
under specified circumstances); upon the infringement of which
conditions the mysterious partner vanishes, leaving the
remaining member of the pair to lament the loss that has been
thus foolishly incurred through curiosity. Here the prohibition
would seem to be imposed with a view to concealing the fact
that the union is based ultimately upon the foundation of an
incestuous affection, or is itself incestuous in nature: a recognition
of this fact would spoil the pleasure of the union by
arousing the repressions connected with incestuous love and
must therefore (as in the case of the marriage between Œdipus
and Jocasta in the Œdipus myth, where Jocasta&mdash;in Sophocles'
play&mdash;strenuously opposes all efforts at investigation) be prevented
by the most rigorous prohibitions, the breaking of which
involves the permanent dissolution of the union.</p>

<p>Among associations other than those of family relationship
<span class="sidenote">Similarity as
a basis of displacement</span>
by means of which the process of displacement is brought
about, those depending on mental or physical similarity are
probably the most important; of all the available methods of
transference, they are too, in many respects, the easiest, most
natural and the least liable to cause pathological aberrations
of development. There can be little doubt, too, that the frequent
occurrence of the displacement of the love impulse along these
lines constitutes a factor of very considerable sociological and
historical importance. The tendency to choose a mate resembling
in some essential aspects&mdash;mental or physical&mdash;one's
<span class="sidenote">Its biological
significance</span>
own nearest relatives, must, for good or evil, act as a potent
means of preserving the purity of individual types and of
family, national or racial qualities; especially when, as may
often happen, there is added to the influence of this factor that
of the narcissistic element of love to which we have already
referred. So long as the associative link which conditions the
displacement is one that has some correspondence to reality,
the closer the unconscious identification of the sexual partner of
adult life with the object loved in infancy, the more likely will it
be for this partner to possess hereditary qualities similar to those
of the lover himself, and the greater therefore, in all probability,
the resemblance of the ensuing offspring to their parents.</p>

<p>Among the similarities of a less essential kind which may
<span class="sidenote">Name</span>
assist in the process of displacement, those of <em>name</em> are apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
play an important but subtle part and one that is very liable
to be overlooked or where observed, ascribed to coincidence
rather than (as it more often should be) to the operation of
unconscious mental factors<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>. They are in some respects a source
of danger, inasmuch as they are concerned with relatively
superficial characteristics<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> which have little to do with the real
nature of the person selected, thus making easy the choice of
otherwise unsuitable objects of affection.</p>

<p>Similarities with the parents as regards <em>age</em> often exercise
<span class="sidenote">Age</span>
some influence in early years and in the early stages of displacement,
but in later life are less operative than, in view of
the intensity of the parent fixation in some individuals, might
perhaps be expected. This is probably due, to a large extent
at any rate, to the fact already referred to, that the unconscious
parent love of adult life has as its object the image
of the parents as they appeared to the child in infancy; these
image-parents being therefore of a considerably younger age
than that which the real parents have actually attained by the
time the child has reached maturity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The similarities as regards <em>general or special circumstances</em>
may also on occasion be important in determining the direction
of transference and in cases where the process of displacement
has suffered an arrest at a comparatively early stage, may
cause serious difficulties or restrictions in the choice of
object.</p>

<p>Thus it may happen that, just as the child's love activities
<span class="sidenote">Falling in love
with those who
are already
married or
betrothed</span>
in relation to its earliest love object were impeded by the
fact that this object was already bound by affection, law or
both, to a third <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'persan'">person</ins> (<em>i. e.</em> the parent of the same sex as
that of the child), so in adult life the individual's choice may
fall only on objects who are similarly not at liberty in the
disposal of their affections<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>. There are indeed some men and
women who can only fall in love with married or betrothed
persons, and who are doomed therefore either to become
dangerous enemies to the harmonious married life of others
or else themselves to suffer successive repetitions of the
unsuccessful love of their childhood<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>. Marriage in such cases
may bring no relief, because the object of their affection may
cease to exercise attraction as soon as its possession is
undisputed and unhindered. The widespread occurrence and
intensity of the unconscious ideas underlying this kind of
aberration is shown by the frequent treatment of the subject
in legend and literature (<em>Cp.</em> Tristan and Iseult, Paolo and
Francesca, Pelleas and Melisande, Don Carlos and his step-mother,
Casandra and a host of other examples in which the expression
and fulfilment of a great love are prevented by the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
one of the lovers is already married or affianced to a third
person, usually a relative, and one who on analysis can
easily be shown to represent the parent who stood in the
way of the first love of the child.)<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>.</p>

<p>In a number of other cases stress is laid not so much on
<span class="sidenote">The desire for
obstacles in the
way of love</span>
the unfree condition of the loved object, but, more generally,
on the barrier raised by the incestuous nature of the desired
relationship. This factor will of course in the majority of cases
merely add its force to those demanding previous marriage
or betrothal to another as a necessary qualification of the
loved object, but will sometimes manifest itself alone as a
felt <em>need for</em> the occurrence of some sort of <em>hindrance</em> to the
consummation of love, the lover being unable to derive full
satisfaction from the union or to remain permanently attracted
to his chosen object in the absence of such hindrance<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>.
Here it will usually be found that the loved object is unconsciously
identified with the parent or with some other near
relation.</p>

<p>In other cases the desire for some kind of obstacle may
manifest itself in a tendency to keep secret the existence and
the circumstances of the love. With persons subject to this
tendency (which would seem to be found more especially among
women) a love affair may lose a great part&mdash;or perhaps the
whole&mdash;of its attractiveness as soon as it is made public and
is openly admitted, as by the act of marriage.</p>

<p>Since the thought of the sexual relations of the parents
<span class="sidenote">The rescue
phantasy</span>
is, both on account of jealousy and on account of the repression
of incestuous cravings, one that is usually extremely
distasteful to the child, the latter often likes to imagine that
the loved parent enters into such relations unwillingly and
under compulsion. Such a belief can arise most easily in a
boy's mind as regards his mother: it then in its turn gives
rise to the idea of rescuing the mother from the unwelcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and tyrannical attentions of the father<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>; a phantasy which has
found expression in the many stories and legends (of which
that of Andromeda and that of St. George are perhaps the
most widely known examples) in which a distressed and
beautiful maiden is delivered by a young knight or hero from
the clutches of a tyrant, giant or monster<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>. This phantasy is
sometimes found too in a sublimated form in which, for instance,
great enthusiasm may be aroused by the effort to deliver a
small or helpless race or nation from the dominion of a
larger and more powerful people<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>, or again by the struggle for
the liberation of an oppressed section of a community from
the tyranny of a ruling class<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>.</p>

<p>The idea of rescue has too, as has recently been discovered,
<span class="sidenote">The symbolic
meaning of the
rescue</span>
a further symbolic meaning, which may be present to the
Unconscious<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>. To rescue means to save from death, <em>i. e.</em> to
present with life, and thus comes to be equated with the
notion of begetting or bringing to life. In this way the rescue
of the mother may signify to the Unconscious a begetting, <em>i. e.</em>
a process of cohabitation with her, the boy thus putting himself
in the place of his father and fulfilling in a symbolic manner
his incestuous desires. As a further determinant of the rescue
phantasy in this sense there is sometimes to be found an
obscure notion of self-begetting&mdash;the creation of oneself without
the co-operation of the parent of one's own sex, all obligation
to and connection with this parent being thus repudiated.
Such a repudiation of the undesired parent may also find
expression in the phantasy of rescuing this parent from
death&mdash;an idea which is not infrequent in legend and folklore:
the obligation that the child had incurred through the gift of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
life by the parent being now cancelled by the incurring of a
similar obligation on the part of the parent towards the child.</p>

<p>Freud has drawn attention to the occurrence of a curious
<span class="sidenote">Hatred and
contempt of
the mother
for permitting
the advances
of the father</span>
case of displacement&mdash;not infrequent among men and of very
considerable importance for subsequent sexual life&mdash;which
seems to depend to some extent at any rate, upon an arrest
in the Unconscious at the stage of secondary mother hatred
or contempt to which we referred on p. 59<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>. In such cases the
mother is not pitied for having to suffer unwelcome advances
from the father, but hated and despised for permitting or
encouraging these advances. The father, being, according to
the estimation of the child's Unconscious, a partner altogether
undesirable, one who would under no circumstances be
preferred to the child himself by any woman of good taste,
the mother is regarded as a person quite lacking in such taste,
a woman who indeed might give herself to <em>anybody</em> (a view
which of course also encourages the hope that she may some
<span class="sidenote">The mother
regarded as a
prostitute</span>
day give herself to the child). If this view should persist in
the Unconscious, the mother may come subsequently to be
regarded as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'a a'">a</ins> sort of <em>prostitute</em>.</p>

<p>Now although such a sequence of ideas in the Unconscious
may lead to contempt of the mother, it has not deprived her
of her original power of attracting love and admiration; it
<span class="sidenote">The
dissociation of
sexual
attractiveness
and esteem</span>
leads rather to a mental splitting up of these original attractive
attributes, the more purely and directly sexual ones being
separated from the other characteristics in virtue of which
she stands as an example of all that is morally desirable in
womanhood. These two different aspects of the mother attributes
are then in later life sought and found in different individuals&mdash;the
sexual attributes in prostitutes or in women of inferior
morality, education, intelligence or social station; the other
attributes&mdash;objects of tender love and admiration&mdash;in women
of a higher standing, towards whom however no physically
sexual attraction can be felt.</p>

<p>This dissociation of purely sexual attraction from tenderness,
esteem and the other components of fully developed love, is,
<span class="sidenote">The importance
of this
dissociation</span>
if we take account of its presence in minor as well as in
major degrees, of such frequent occurrence, that it has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
regarded by some as a normal feature of the sex impulse in
the human male. It is at the same time a feature which cannot
but be productive of harm in a monogamous society, so that
if Freud's explanation of its origin should prove to be one that
is at all generally valid, this aberrant process of development
must be regarded as one that entails very serious consequences
of an ethical and sociological as well as of a psychological
nature, and one therefore to whose incidence, genesis, growth
and history a little further consideration may perhaps not
unprofitably be devoted here.</p>

<p>The dissociation between the more purely sexual constituents
<span class="sidenote">Influences
in later life
which are
liable to
reinforce it</span>
of love and the elements of esteem, reverence and
tenderness which is originally brought about in the manner
indicated by Freud, probably owes much of its prevalence and
importance in later life to the fact that, once established, it is
very apt to be strengthened and maintained by certain of the
conditions under which the development of a youth's sexual
knowledge is liable to occur. Among the most important of
these conditions are the two following:</p>

<p>(1) The first actual experience of acute sensory pleasure of
<span class="sidenote">Masturbation</span>
a sexual kind about the time of puberty is very frequently
associated with the act of masturbation, which in its turn is
often accompanied by visual phantasies in which the rôle of
sexual partner is played by women or girls known to the boy.
As masturbation itself is usually carried on in the face of
considerable psychic opposition, being looked upon as sordid,
disgusting or injurious to health, there is not unnaturally a
reluctance to bring into connection with this manifestation of
the sexual impulse any woman or girl who is sincerely and
profoundly loved, esteemed or honoured; those introduced
into the masturbation phantasies being therefore such who,
while not devoid of superficial sexual attractiveness, nevertheless
display some real or supposed inferiority (as regards beauty,
virtue, social standing or what not), as a result of which they
make no appeal to the boy's sense of higher moral values.
Through frequent repetition of this process, women of an
inferior type come to be firmly associated with the more
directly sexual aspects of love, from which women who are
looked upon with tenderness or veneration are correspondingly
dissociated, lest these dear objects of affection should be sullied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
by being brought into contact with what the boy regards as
dishonourable, lewd or filthy<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>.</p>

<p>(2) At a later stage of development the original dissociation
<span class="sidenote">Prostitution</span>
thus reinforced is frequently still further strengthened by the
association (in thought or deed or both) of sexual practices
with prostitutes&mdash;a class of women whom the youth is himself
prepared to condemn because of the already existing connection
in his mind between inferiority and sex, and as regards whose
condemnation from the moral point of view he, as a rule, finds
ample corroboration in the opinions expressed or implied by
those around him.</p>

<p>The moral degradation of the sexual object thus receives
<span class="sidenote">Effect of the
dissociation on
marriage</span>
its final confirmation, and when later in marriage the young
man endeavours to unite esteem and tenderness with sexual
passion, he may find that the dissociation between these
elements of love has grown too wide and fundamental to be
overcome, so that one or other of these requisites of a complete
and happy married life has necessarily to be sacrificed.
As a result of this, a man may marry a woman whom he is
prepared indeed to cherish, honour and esteem, but towards
whom (for this very reason) he feels himself but little attracted
in a purely sexual sense; in which case he will often be
tempted after a while to seek a more complete degree of
sexual satisfaction elsewhere. Or else, should the directly sexual
trends prevail, he may select a partner who is inferior to him
in some important intellectual, moral or social respect, thus
paving the way for a married life in which many of his more
sublimated tendencies, desires and aspirations are doomed to
suffer permanent lack of gratification<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that women are, on the whole,
<span class="sidenote">The liability
of women to a
corresponding
dissociation</span>
less liable to suffer from this kind of dissociation than are men.
With women the directly sexual elements of love are more
frequently aroused together with the elements of tenderness
and esteem, than is the case with men. Thus many women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
experience sexual desire or gratification <em>only</em> in relation to
men to whom they are bound also by feelings of deep affection,
admiration or respect. This difference between the sexes is
perhaps to some extent a constitutional one, the elements in
question being by nature more intimately fused and integrated
in one sex than in the other<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>. Some part of the difference is
however due, beyond all reasonable doubt, to environmental
and educational factors.</p>

<p>Of the three principal factors we have enumerated as
liable to bring about a high degree of dissociation between
sexual attraction and esteem in men, it seems probable that
the first&mdash;that due to the child's contempt for the (otherwise)
loved parent for yielding to the sexual advances of the hated
parent&mdash;is almost if not quite as potent with women as with
men. The subsequent reinforcement of the dissociation by the
two remaining factors is however to a considerable extent inoperative
with women. The influence of masturbation is in
nearly all respects less marked in women than in men, partly
perhaps because at the important age, at or about the time
of puberty, the practice is less frequent with girls than with
boys, but principally because for a variety of reasons it meets
with less violent psychic opposition, arouses less violent moral
conflicts and is to a much lesser extent liable to become the
cause of self-contempt or self-reproach<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>. Nor again is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
association of sexual activity with prostitution (although the act
of prostitution itself may be regarded with considerable repulsion)
so deeply ingrained in women as in men.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of the lesser operation of these factors
in the case of women and in spite of any possible closer
connection (through innate organization) of the elements of the
love impulse which are liable to dissociation, it is nevertheless
true that a very considerable number of women do suffer from
some degree of this dissociation<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>.</p>

<p>Such women will often be attracted to two kinds of men&mdash;one
<span class="sidenote">Manifestations
of the dissociation
in women</span>
of which (frequently physically inferior) may arouse
sympathy, respect, devotion or tenderness, while the other
(frequently of a morally, socially or intellectually inferior type,
but often physically superior<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>) will alone be capable of arousing
sexual desire. Quite often the attraction to an inferior person
is combined with the desire for clandestinity to which we
referred above; the whole complex finding its most satisfying
and appropriate expression in a furtive love affair of such a
kind as to be contrary to the moral or social standards of the
woman's upbringing and environment. It is obvious that the
difficulties which bar the way to a completely successful
marriage for such women are but little if at all inferior to
those existing in the case of men who suffer from a corresponding
condition of dissociation<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>In a certain number of cases there is to be observed a
<span class="sidenote">Combination of
the prostitute
and rescue
phantasies</span>
combination of the original prostitute phantasy (the remoter
consequences of which we have been here considering) with
the rescue phantasy to which we referred above. Such a
combination of motives may give rise to the enthusiasm for
"rescue work" as displayed by such persons as John Storm in
Sir Hall Caine's novel "The Christian" or, more generally, may
bring about the desire to lead the prostitute, fallen or abandoned
woman (mother substitute) to a better way of life (<em>Cp.</em> Hamlet
and his mother)<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a>. In women too this combination of motives
may not infrequently be observed, manifesting itself most often
as a desire to effect the regeneration of some drunkard, ne'er-do-well
or criminal or of some class of men of this description;
sometimes leading even to marriage with a person of this
kind, with a view to the better attainment of this end (though
in these cases the superior sexual attractiveness of such men
is of course usually an additional&mdash;though not always a recognised&mdash;motive).</p>

<p>In still other cases again the intensely disagreeable feeling
<span class="sidenote">The desire for
chastity</span>
that is associated with the idea of the mother giving herself
to the father may lead to an overwhelming desire for the
strictest previous chastity in any woman that may be selected
as bride or sexual partner; the virginity of the later love
serving as a recompense for the supposed impurity and faithlessness
of the earlier object of affection, and to some extent
no doubt (through the process of identification) bringing
about&mdash;so far as the unconscious mind of the lover is concerned&mdash;a
purification of this former object. Such feelings as
these, working in the Unconscious, are probably among the
most powerful factors which determine the behaviour of that
not inconsiderable number of men whose affection and general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
attitude towards a woman are completely changed by the
merest suspicion that she has experienced sexual relationships
with any but themselves, however great the extenuating
circumstances connected with such relationships; who are
utterly unable to entertain the idea of marriage with any
such woman (<em>Cp.</em> Angel Clare in Thomas Hardy's "Tess of
the d'Urbervilles") or who in temporary or venal intercourse
will go to much trouble or expense to secure a virgin for
their partner<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>.</p>

<p>The brief review which we have undertaken in this
<span class="sidenote">The importance
of displacement
in the love life</span>
chapter of the displacement of the love impulse from persons
of the immediate family environment to objects selected from
a wider circle, is sufficient to show that the whole nature
and course of the love life of an individual is to a very large
extent dependent on the way in which this displacement is
achieved<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>. There is little doubt but that the further advance of
psychological science will reveal more intimately the working
of those mechanisms with which we have here been dealing,
and of whose nature and importance we are now beginning
to gain some rough preliminary understanding. In view of the
desirability of a satisfactory direction of the love impulse, as
well from the point of view of national and racial well-being
as from that of individual happiness and family prosperity, it
is to be expected that the further enlightenment which we
may hope for on this subject, will be, both practically and
theoretically, as important as any which the science of Psychology
will bring us.</p>

<br />
FAMILY INFLUENCES IN SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT</h2>


<p>In studying the hate aspects of the original Œdipus complex
<span class="sidenote">Displacements
of hate less
complex than
those of love</span>
we saw that these aspects, on their first appearance and in so
far as they depend on mere jealousy or envy, are secondary
products, arising as a consequence of the love aspects. When
the cause of the jealousy is removed by a successful displacement
of the love impulse, there is no longer any reason for the
continuance of the hate. It is probably for this reason that
the displacements of the hate aspects appear to be, on the
whole, less numerous and less complicated than those of the
love aspects.</p>

<p>Certain forms of love displacement, it is true, necessarily
imply, to some extent, correlative forms of hate displacement;
as in the case (studied in the last chapter) of the transfer of
love exclusively to married or betrothed persons or in the
case of the rescue phantasy. In these cases the rival with
whom the lover competes for the possession of the loved object
or the tyrant from whose clutches the captive lady is snatched
by the skill or daring of the youthful hero, are (in the light
of psycho-analytic knowledge) manifest substitutes for the original
rival or tyrant who existed in the person of the father. The
intensity of hostile feeling of which these representatives become
the objects may however vary very considerably from one
instance to another, according as the emphasis of the whole
phantasy is laid upon the elements of hatred or of love. Sometimes
the hostile rival may be present only in a vague and
shadowy form, constituting little more than a necessary background;
as, for instance, in cases where the existence of some
kind of opposition is essential to the arousal or enjoyment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
love. In other cases, however, the hate element may be equal
in importance to the love element, or may even constitute the
predominant motive of the whole displacement.</p>

<p>In these latter cases it will usually be found that the
<span class="sidenote">The development
of hate</span>
hostility brought about secondarily as the result of jealousy has
been powerfully reinforced by hatred of a more direct and
independent kind, arising as a reaction against a more general
interference with the child's aspirations or desires on the part
of a tyrannous parental authority (or one that is considered to
be such). The presence, in some degree, of this form of reaction
is very prevalent, and this is not surprising when we bear in
mind the fact that the child has, during its early years, to be
continually moderated, guided, stimulated or restrained in its
actions, or tendencies to action, by the exercise of parental or
of delegated parental authority<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>.</p>

<p>The exercise of such restraint or guidance, even within
necessary and desirable limits and with all the care, refinement
and regard to the child's own natural course of development
which modern methods of training may dictate, is bound to
give rise to <em>some</em> feeling of resentment, especially in children
of self-willed, obstinate or independent character or in those
with whom the tendencies in need of guidance or restraint are
unusually vigorous or persistent. Much more so even is this
liable to be the case where (as may often happen) the child's
upbringing is carried out with but little regard for, or understanding
of, its own feelings, susceptibilities or tendencies. In
all such cases the hostile sentiments aroused by the conflict
of parental authority with the impetuous desires of childhood
may be such as to outlast the period of early life to which
they properly belong and to furnish a basis for a pathological
fixation at the stage of parent-hatred, as a result of which this
hatred may constitute an important&mdash;and usually maleficent&mdash;component
of the individual's character throughout his life.</p>

<p>We have already, in the earlier chapters, discussed the
<span class="sidenote">Displacement
of hate on to
parent
substitutes</span>
manner in which parent hatred of early origin (together with
most other aspects of the young child's attitude towards its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
parents) should, in the course of normal development, be overcome.
We have already seen, however, that certain of the
secondary hatreds consequent upon incestuous love are in many
individuals incapable of being completely and satisfactorily
resolved in any of the normal ways, but become, instead,
displaced on to parent substitutes in the same way as the love
impulses which they accompany. The same fate of displacement
awaits, in most cases, those more direct and primary hatreds
which are consequent upon the parent's interference with the
child's more general wishes and desires. In the course of the
individual's life, the authority over his expressions, activities
and general mode of living originally exercised by the parents,
passes in succession, wholly or partly, to a number of other
persons; to whom the feelings directed to the parents in virtue
of the exercise of this authority is then transferred. Among
those to whom such transference most frequently and regularly
takes place are to be found&mdash;nurses, teachers, school prefects,
police officers, employers, professional or military superiors, or
persons occupying general positions of command, such as
magistrates, statesmen or kings.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that much of the general
<span class="sidenote">This displacement
may lead
to rebellion
against
authority and
the persons
who
exercise it</span>
resistance to, and intolerance of, authority, that may be exhibited
by certain individuals, or at times by whole sections
of a community (or even by whole peoples) derives its motive
power from a persistence in the Unconscious of parent hatreds
of this kind. A very considerable proportion of criminal actions
in the individual are also due to the same unconscious source,
the still existing desire to resist the authority of the parents
finding outlet in a displaced form in infringements of the laws,
conventions, or regulations imposed by the authority of society
or of the State. Particularly is this true of crimes against
persons who embody or exercise this authority&mdash;emperors,
kings and other persons in high places, and it would seem
probable indeed that many cases of regicide or of attempts on
the lives of official personages have been committed by those
suffering from insufficiently controlled parent hatreds of unusual
strength. Bearing in mind the dangers that beset a community
in which tendencies to anarchy, lawlessness or unreasonable
opposition to governmental authority are widespread,
it is obvious that the frequent occurrence of violent and persistent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
parent hatreds in children, leading, as they so often do,
to displacements of this kind, is a matter of very serious
sociological and political importance<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>.</p>

<p>These same persons in authority, who thus become the
<span class="sidenote">Displacements
of respect and
esteem</span>
recipients displaced enmity towards the parents, may however
also serve in later life as substitutes for those aspects of
the parents in virtue of which these latter were in childhood
reverenced as the possessors of unlimited power, wisdom,
virtue or knowledge (<em>Cp.</em> above p. 54). Especially is this the case
perhaps with regard to ecclesiastical authorities; the priest, as
the interpreter of wisdom that transcends earthly knowledge and
the transmitter of commands that transcend earthly authority,
being peculiarly suitable as an object of this emotional attitude.
The head of the Roman Catholic Church has indeed, through the
doctrine of infallibility, been explicitly endowed (with reference
to a certain sphere of thought) with the character of perfect
knowledge and perfect wisdom, which the young child with the
sense of its own immense inferiority in these respects, is liable
to attribute to its parents. The teacher too, in his position of
moral and intellectual authority, frequently becomes the recipient
of similar feelings; the additional influence which he possesses
over his pupils through the latter's childish over-estimation of his
knowledge and capacity often receiving frank acknowledgment
in the fact of his unwillingness ever to appear to have been
mistaken or to have been ignorant with regard to any matter,
lest the realisation of his fallibility should detract from the
suggestive power that he has hitherto enjoyed.</p>

<p>The displacement on to medical advisers and attendants
<span class="sidenote">Medical
practitioners
as parent-substitutes</span>
originally directed to the parents, has frequently
been recognised. Here again, it is more particularly the attribute
of benevolent omniscience that is liable to be transferred.
Three factors contribute especially to this result:&mdash;(1) The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
physician's knowledge on matters of the highest interest
and importance, about which others are relatively ignorant
(particularly perhaps "medical" matters, in the sexual sense
of that euphemism); (2) the fact that the situations in
which his assistance is called in, for the most part urgently
demand some kind of action which he alone can adequately
perform; the sense of helplessness which others feel in these
situations being similar in many respects to that frequently
experienced in early years when, as children, we were dependent
upon the efforts of our parents in many of the important
affairs of life; (3) the fact that this sense of helplessness and
the general attitude of suggestibility are still further increased
in the case of the patient by the general regression to a relatively
childish state of mind which illness so frequently brings
in its train. The physician's capacity to stimulate and maintain
the power of suggestion, which he possesses in virtue of this
attitude on the part of those who consult him, is undoubtedly
the secret of much real success in medical practice, inasmuch
as the mental factors in disease&mdash;the importance of which is
now becoming fully recognised, although their nature is not yet
always clear&mdash;are to a large extent directly affected by the
patient's belief in his doctor's ability to understand and cure
the complaint from which he suffers.</p>

<p>This suggestive power plays of course a specially prominent
<span class="sidenote">The rôle of
parent-regarding
tendencies
in suggestion
and hypnosis</span>
part in dealing with disorders of a directly psychopathic
nature<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and peculiarly so where a condition of enhanced
suggestibility is deliberately induced and utilised with a view
to the cure of such disorders, as in the practice of hypnotism.
The work which has been directed to the study of hypnotism
from the psycho-analytic point of view has brought out very
clearly the similarities between the condition in hypnosis and
some of the mental characteristics of early childhood; and has
led to the conception of the hypnotic trance as a regression
to a relatively infantile state of mind, the <em>rapport</em> between
operator and subject being regarded as, in certain important
respects, a repetition or revival of the relations which had
previously existed between parent and child. Ferenczi<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
gone so far as to regard the different methods of inducing
hypnosis as depending upon a revival in a displaced form of
the child's typical attitude towards its father or its mother
respectively; the stern, commanding, confident tone, adopted
by some operators, tending to bring about a relationship
between them and their subjects that constitutes a revival of
the former relationship between father and child, the calming,
soothing, soporific methods of others serving to recall the
attitude of the child towards its mother, as when in early infancy
it was lulled to sleep by its mother with the aid of a
very similar procedure.</p>

<p>In the practice of psycho-analysis, too, the displacement of
<span class="sidenote">"Transference"
in
psychoanalysis</span>
emotional attitudes originally adopted with reference to the
parents has been shown to play an important part, though the
therapeutic effect of the method is not, as has sometimes
erroneously been supposed, due to the simple action of
suggestion<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>. Psycho-analysis aims at producing a state of greater
co-ordination in the patient's mind by giving him an understanding
of the nature and direction of his unconscious mental
trends, thus putting him in a position to bring about a state
of relative harmony between the different impulses which
formerly, by their mutual antagonisms, were responsible for
the production of the neurosis. A mere understanding of the
nature of the unconscious processes involved is however, as
has frequently been shown, powerless to effect the desired
result, unless the conative and affective sides of these processes
are also loosened from their fixations in the Unconscious and
made available for use in other directions. It is here that the
transference of tendencies originally directed to the parents
becomes important. Just as, in the first unfolding and development
of the child's emotional capacities, the direction of the
love impulses on to the parents was the means of bringing the
child beyond the primitive stages of auto-erotism and narcissism,
so now in the emotional re-education that psycho-analysis involves,
the further process of displacement of the parent love
on to new objects is one of fundamental importance and is
often an essential condition of the necessary readjustment and
integration of the emotional life. Not of course that the parent-love
is the only impulse requiring displacement in this way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
but, inasmuch as the Œdipus Complex is (as Freud has put it)
the nuclear complex of the neuroses, it is just the emotions
that centre round the parents that usually constitute the most
fundamental and far-reaching, as well as in themselves the most
massive and weighty, of those that need readjustment as regards
their object. In this process of readjustment, the analyst himself&mdash;as
is now well recognised&mdash;usually plays a highly important,
though a transitory, rôle; the emotions loosened from
their fixations by the process of analysis being temporarily displaced
on to his person, (on their way to more suitable and
permanent objects) both because he is the first available object,
and because his position of authority as the conductor of the
analysis naturally suits him for the part<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>.</p>

<p>It is principally because a displacement of this sort can be
<span class="sidenote">Transference
and the cure
of neuroses</span>
much more easily produced in certain kinds of neurosis than
in others, that neuroses differ from one another markedly in
their amenability to treatment; what Freud has called the
Transference Neuroses<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> (such as Hysteria or Obsessional
Neurosis), in which the patient, though unable to adjust his
emotions to the level required for satisfactory adult life, has
nevertheless for the most part attained&mdash;and retained&mdash;the
stage of object-love, comparing very favourably in this respect
with the Narcissistic Neuroses (such as Paranoia), in which the
patient has regressed beyond the stage of object-love to the
relatively infantile level at which his emotional outlets are
sought only in, or in connection with, his own person.</p>

<p>All the displacements with which we have been hitherto
<span class="sidenote">The displacement
of parent-regarding
feelings, on
to objects
other than
individuals</span>
concerned have at least this one important feature in common,
that the feelings and tendencies originally directed to the
parents are transferred to definite individuals. There are, however,
certain forms of displacement, of very considerable
sociological importance, in which this is no longer the case,
the parent substitutes being found, not in any individual
persons, but in groups, places, societies and institutions.</p>

<p>Thus in many cases the home, as the place in which the
<span class="sidenote">Home</span>
parents lived and in which the feelings of love, tenderness and
admiration towards the parents were first developed, acquires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
and retains throughout life a peculiar attractiveness, in which
piety, tenderness and pride are intermingled and which is, it
would seem, to a very large extent derived from the emotional
attitude of the child towards the parents themselves. The
attachment to the home in this sense frequently manifests
itself in home-sickness whenever the individual is compelled to
leave his native place or native land; those who suffer from
home-sickness to an unusual degree or for an unusual length
of time being in most cases burdened with an overstrong
attachment to and dependence on their family, or certain
members of it, having failed to free themselves adequately
from their infantile fixations in this direction.</p>

<p>In certain persons again&mdash;especially in members of an
<span class="sidenote">Family or Clan</span>
aristocratic caste or in others who are able to trace their
descent through a long line of ancestors&mdash;some important
aspects of the parent-love come to be attached to the idea of
the whole family of which they form a part; the tendencies to
esteem, obedience, admiration or idealisation originally aroused
by the child's immediate parents being transferred to the family
or clan regarded as a social group, which has existed in the
past, exists now in those of its members who happen to be
living and will continue to exist in their descendants. This
kind of transference may constitute a sublimation of considerable
value, inasmuch as it may afford a powerful motive to
the individual for not falling below the level of attainment or
civic worth that is expected of the family, and generally for
doing all that may enhance, and avoiding all that may degrade,
the family reputation; on the other hand, it may sometimes be
productive of an undue tendency towards conservatism and
may lead to the stifling of individual effort, independence and
initiative, through the imposition of a too uniform standard
of conduct and achievement or a too close adherence to
tradition.</p>

<p>In many persons, again, the school, as the centre of
<span class="sidenote">School</span>
influence that succeeds in time (and often in importance) to
that constituted by the family circle, naturally draws to itself
many of the emotions which had hitherto found their exclusive
outlet in the family; loyalty and obedience to school traditions,
together with respect, tenderness, pride and admiration for the
school as a collective body replacing to some extent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
corresponding feelings which had previously been experienced
principally or solely in relation to the parents.</p>

<p>At a later age, these same feelings may be again displaced
<span class="sidenote">University</span>
on to a College or University; the term <em>Alma Mater</em>, so
frequently applied to the latter, bearing witness to the extent
to which a University is habitually endowed with maternal
attributes&mdash;being regarded as a kindly mother (often of
venerable age and experience) who imparts to her sons the
learning and wisdom that she possesses, and generally equips
them for the tasks and trials of life in the outer world.</p>

<p>Towns<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> may also become the recipients of parentally, and
<span class="sidenote">Town</span>
especially maternally, directed feeling; those who love and
admire a town often referring to it in terms which would be
more directly appropriate to a woman; a woman behind whom
the mother image can usually be discovered. The emotions
aroused by the besieging, attacking or capturing of towns in
warfare are also in part derived from the same source.</p>

<p>The same feeling too is often directed to houses, ships,
<span class="sidenote">Other objects</span>
churches (and especially to the institution of the Church; <em>cp.</em> the
phrase "Mother Church"); also to trees, woods, mountains,
lakes, rivers, the sea and other natural objects.</p>

<p>Probably the most important displacement of this kind
<span class="sidenote">The attitude of
the individual
to the state:</span>
from the sociological point of view is that in which parental
attributes are transferred to the community, state, or country.
The mental ties that bind the individual to the community are
of course complex in nature, comprising emotional and intellectual
factors belonging to a variety of psychic levels. Among the
most fundamental and deep seated of these factors are, as
Ernest Jones<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> has pointed out, those that take their origin
in feelings that regard the self, the mother and the father
respectively.</p>

<p>The self-regarding tendencies are enlisted in the service
<span class="sidenote">Self-regarding
tendencies</span>
of patriotism;&mdash;on the conscious, intellectual level, through a
recognition of the community of interest between the individual
and the state; on the more primitive, emotional and unconscious
level, through a process of identification of the individual with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the state, as a result of which the former participates in the
successes and failures of the latter in much the same way as
if they affected him directly and principally in his own person.
In these latter respects the feelings of the individual towards
the state are similar in many ways to those that are involved
in a corresponding identification of the self with the family,
the school or any other group with whose prosperity and
honour the well-being and self-respect of the individual is
bound up.</p>

<p>The displacement of the mother-regarding feelings on to
<span class="sidenote">Mother regarding
tendencies</span>
state is, it would seem, chiefly connected with the ideas
of being nourished, trained and protected, on the one hand,
and of actively protecting, on the other. Thus we tend to
regard our native land as a great mother who brings into
being, nourishes, protects and cherishes her sons and daughters
and inspires them with respect and love for herself and her
traditions, customs, beliefs and institutions; in return for which
her children are prepared to work and fight for her&mdash;and above
all, to protect her from her enemies; a good deal of the horror
and disgust which is inspired by the idea of an invasion of
one's native land by a hostile army being due to the
unconscious tendency to regard such an invasion as a desecration
and violation of the mother.</p>

<p>In the displacement of the father-regarding feelings on to
<span class="sidenote">Father-regarding
tendencies</span>
the state, the tendencies connected with the attitude of respect,
obedience and loyalty to the paternal authority are usually the
most prominent. Great importance is moreover almost invariably
attached to the head of the state as its embodiment and its
supreme authority, the country over which he rules being
looked upon as his possession or estate, which it is the duty
of his children to uphold, to protect or to enlarge. Kings, as
we have already seen, are habitually identified in the Unconscious
with the father, as are other persons in positions of authority,
and it is interesting to note that the evidence of language and
of certain common appellations applied to these persons fully
endorses the conclusions of Psycho-Analysis in this respect.
Thus, as Rank<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> and Jones<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>, following Max Müller, have pointed
out, the word king is ultimately derived from the Sanskrit root<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
<em>gan</em>, meaning to beget, <em>ganaka</em> being Sanskrit for father. The
Czar of Russia was until recently called the "Little Father,"
the same title as the Hunnish Attila (diminutive of Atta = father).
The title "Landesvater" is commonly used in Germany just as
the Americans still call Washington the Father of his Country.
The ruler of the Roman Catholic Church is called the "Holy Father,"
or by his Latin name of "Papa<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>" (from the root <em>pa</em> to protect,
nourish). Similarly, the word "queen" comes from the Sanskrit
<em>ganí</em>, which means mother (Greek [Greek: gynê], Gothic <em>quinô</em>)<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and a
queen who has had children, is the mother of the reigning
monarch or has merely attained to a certain age, is frequently
spoken of as the "Queen Mother."</p>

<p>There are considerable differences, both individual and
<span class="sidenote">Political
importance
of these
tendencies</span>
national, as regards the relative importance of the father and
the mother elements respectively in the general attitude adopted
towards the state, and it would seem probable that these
differences are apt to lead to, or at least to be correlated with,
political characteristics of very great importance. Thus England
is looked upon almost entirely as a mother, the father-regarding
aspects of an Englishman's feeling for his country playing but
a very minor part in the formation of his total attitude; the
same is in the main true of modern&mdash;as distinct from prerevolutionary&mdash;France
(though, as Ernest Jones<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> points out,
the term 'la patrie'&mdash;combining as it does a feminine form with
a masculine connotation&mdash;implies to some extent the co-operation
of both elements), while the colossal female statue of Liberty
at the entrance to New York would certainly seem to indicate
that the land of freedom which the traveller is approaching is
to be regarded as an embodiment of the matriarchal, rather
than of the patriarchal, aspects of human society. Germany, on
the other hand, is habitually spoken of as the Fatherland;
while in Russia the Czar was regarded, to a unique extent
perhaps among modern nations, as the Father of his country.
The tendency to blind loyalty and obedience manifested in
these latter countries compared, until recently, most markedly
with the relatively free and unconstrained affection exhibited
by the citizens of the former states towards their native land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
and suggests the existence of a fairly close correspondence, on
the one hand between the maternal view of the state and the
development of democratic institutions and individual independence,
and on the other hand between the paternal view and
the development and retention of autocracy and a relatively
strict subordination of the individual to the authority of the
government and of its representatives.</p>

<p>It would be possible also perhaps to point to a general
tendency towards a similar association of the mother-regarding
attitude with a trend towards change, progress or instability,
and of the father-regarding attitude with a corresponding trend
towards stability and conservatism; though the extreme
progressiveness, in certain respects, of modern Germany has
shown that any such tendency does not hold for all cases or
for all aspects of culture.</p>

<p>Where the attitude towards the state, its institutions and
authority is not one of love, friendliness or reverence, but one
of hate and rebellion, it is of course the corresponding feelings
of hostility towards the parents which play a leading part in
the unconscious motivation of malcontents or revolutionaries.
It is principally for this reason that revolutions in autocratic
paternal states (<em>cp.</em> the recent upheavals in Russia and Germany
and the French Revolution) are usually more violent and extreme
than in the case of the freer and more liberal maternal
countries, since the desire for rebellion in early family life is
generally directed against the authority of the father to a much
greater extent than against that of the mother.</p>

<p>There probably exists, moreover, as Rank<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> and Jones<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
have already suggested, a considerable degree of correspondence
<span class="sidenote">Family
organisation
and State
organisation</span>
between the nature of the family system as found in any
country and some of the political features to which we have
referred. Thus the authority of the head of the household&mdash;the
<em>patria potestas</em>&mdash;was perhaps more developed among the
Romans than among any other western people, and the
Romans elaborated a military and civil administration of such
strength and durability that the whole of western civilisation
has to a large extent been raised and developed on the
foundation and the model it afforded. With the Jews also the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
patriarchal system was developed to its fullest extent and this
people has shown its inherent conservatism and stability by
the preservation of many of its characteristic physical, psychological,
moral and social qualities, though homeless for upwards
of two thousand years. Among Oriental nations, the Chinese
are distinguished for their rigid system of family rule and
individual subordination to the parents and they evolved a
civilisation which lasted almost without change for a period
that is without parallel in recorded human history. On the
other hand it is notorious that in times of rapid social change
or political upheaval, family ties and family authority tend to
be relaxed, the individual asserting his freedom in domestic
as well as in political matters; and it is probable that there
exists a tendency for all periods of national or racial instability,
whether leading to development or to degeneration, to be
characterised by a relaxation or throwing off of parental
authority and tradition; though it is obvious that, owing to the
great complexity of the factors involved in the rise or fall, expansion
or decay of nations, the correspondence cannot be an
absolute one.</p>

<p>As regards the attitude adopted by the individual member
<span class="sidenote">Ambivalent
attitude
towards the
king</span>
of a state towards the king or ruler, Freud has shown<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> that
it tends to be, in Bleuler's useful phrase, ambivalent, <em>i. e.</em>, to
be determined by two motives of opposite character, in one
of which hate is the principal element, in the other love. This
ambivalency manifests itself most clearly in the many restrictions
and taboos that are attached to, or connected with, the office
of king in different parts of the world, and that are to some
extent still operative even in civilised societies at the present
day. These taboos are in the main of two kinds:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Those that restrict the activities of the king himself, such
<span class="sidenote">Taboos affecting
the king as
manifestations
of this attitude</span>
as the rules in virtue of which he may only live in certain
places, go out at certain times or eat certain foods, must avoid
all situations involving danger of any kind and must submit to
a cumbrous, wearisome and often exhausting system of court
routine and ceremony. Taboos of this kind would seem on
analysis to have two main objects:&mdash;(a) to guard the king from
any harm, (b) to limit his power in a variety of ways, and
generally to make his life burdensome and unpleasant (under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the guise of assuring his dignity or safety). The exaggerated
fear of some harm coming to the king, which is manifested in
(a), arises by way of a reaction against the unconscious <em>desire</em>
that some harm <em>may</em> befall him, in the same way as an
exaggerated and unreasonable anxiety as regards the health
and welfare of some relative usually indicates a repressed
feeling of hostility towards that relative (<em>cp.</em> above p. 57);
while (b) even more obviously involves elements of fear and of
hostility.</p>

<p>(2) Taboos that affect the subjects in their relations to the
king, such as those which forbid looking at, or touching, the
king, or the touching or eating of his food, or the touching
or removal of his personal effects. These may likewise be
traced to two predominant motives:&mdash;(a) the desire, as before, to
preserve the king from any harm&mdash;in this case more especially
from harm that may result from the actions of those about him;
(b) the desire to avoid any harm befalling the subjects as a result
of influences emanating from the king, the latter being regarded
as a potent but mysterious source of danger to all who rashly
approach or come in contact with him. The latter tendency, with
its correlative belief, arises as the result of a projection of the
hostility felt towards the king; this hostility (in accordance with
the mechanism of Projection&mdash;now well recognised both in normal
and in abnormal psychology)<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>, being falsely attributed to its object,
instead of to the person in whose mind it really originates.</p>

<p>In both sets of taboos the presence of hostility towards
the king is thus made manifest, the taboos themselves arising
chiefly as a result of this hostility and aiming only secondarily,
and by way of reaction, at an increase of the king's safety,
dignity or happiness.</p>

<p>The reality of this hostile feeling is placed beyond all
<span class="sidenote">Hostility
towards
and murder
of the king</span>
reasonable doubt when we bear in mind the frequent occurrence
of openly cruel practices, such as imprisonment, enforced
immobility<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>, starvation<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>, or even beating<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>, especially when we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
take into consideration the very widespread custom of killing
the king at the end of his period of office or as soon as his
strength or ability show signs of failing&mdash;a sinister theme which
Frazer has treated with such charm of manner and such
wealth of erudition in the twelve immortal volumes of the
Golden Bough. Both on account of the actual nature of many
of its manifestations<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and because of the close unconscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
identification of king and father, to which we have already
referred, it is evident that this hostility is in many of its aspects
a displaced form of the hate elements of the Œdipus complex;
the historical, sociological and political bearings of which acquire
in this light, and in the light of the other facts and considerations
brought forward in this chapter, a new, and in many
respects an altogether overwhelming, significance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a><span class="small80">CHAPTER XIII</span><br />
<br />
FAMILY INFLUENCES IN RELIGION</h2>


<p>We saw in the last chapter that the feelings with which
<span class="sidenote">The role of
parent-regarding
feelings in
primitive
notions
concerning
the Divine</span>
men tend to look upon the holders of the highest earthly
dignity and power&mdash;the heads of churches, states and empires&mdash;are
to a large extent derived from those which had originally
shaped and coloured the child's attitude towards its parents.
From the position of supreme human authority to that of
superhuman power is, in imagination, but one further step; and
accordingly we find that the tendencies and emotions connected
with the parents can frequently and easily, by a further process
of displacement, bridge over the gulf between kings and gods;
and, by their association with the ideas of the Superhuman
and the Divine, become important factors in moulding the
religious feelings of mankind.</p>

<p>Apart from this however, reasons for the transfer of many
of the parent-regarding emotions to the sphere of religion are
not far to seek. There exists a close and obvious correspondence
between the attitude of the young child towards his parents
and that of man towards the superhuman powers which he
personifies as God, the Divine Father. In both cases the
individual's life and destiny are controlled by powers that seem,
in comparison with his own puny capacity and understanding,
to be immeasurable in their might and mystery. In both cases
the health, happiness and even the very existence of the
individual seem to be dependent upon the beneficence and
approval of these powers; powers which can be terrible, and
against which no effort will avail, if once aroused to wrath;
but which nevertheless can be to some extent controlled and
made to work in harmony with the individual's needs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
desires, if the latter will but conduct himself towards them
obediently and with due persuasiveness and understanding.</p>

<p>Small wonder then that the adult human being, confronted
with the mighty forces of nature, the laws of which he is
compelled to follow, if he would avoid destruction, but which&mdash;especially
if he be ignorant or uncivilised&mdash;he cannot comprehend,
tends to revert to the attitude of mind in which, in
childhood, he looked upon his parents as the forces&mdash;equally
powerful, as they then seemed, and equally inscrutable&mdash;that
controlled his fate. In proportion as the child, with increasing
age and experience, loses the delusions he had entertained as
regards the all-powerfulness, all-knowingness and all-goodness
of his parents, he begins to realise, both from his own experience
and from instruction and tradition, that there are powers in
the Universe which exceed the greatest human might, powers
before whom the child's own parents&mdash;together with all other
mortals&mdash;must acknowledge their own humility and impotence,
powers so vast that it may seem only reasonable and befitting
to regard the wielder of them as the possessor of those qualities
of omnipotence and omniscience that were once, in the crude
ignorance of infancy, vaguely attributed to the parents and to
other adult persons of importance. The divine and superhuman
forces, about which the child thus begins to have some notions,
constitute in this way a very natural substitute for the exaggerated
and idealised estimation of the parents which the child's increasing
knowledge of human life compels him to abandon, but
which he nevertheless, as we have seen (<em>cp.</em> above p. <a href="#Page_55">55</a>), gives
up reluctantly.</p>

<p>The displacement of the parent-regarding emotions and
<span class="sidenote">The divine
and the human
parent</span>
tendencies in this direction is, in the case of the individual,
often further facilitated in the three following ways:&mdash;(1) owing
to the generally pronounced animistic tendency of the primitive
mind, the child naturally and indeed inevitably conceives of
natural forces in a personal and usually in a human form;
(2) the child early learns to conceive of the supreme forces of
the Universe as creative&mdash;creative on a large scale, just as
his own parents and other human beings are creative on a
small scale; further he learns that he owes his own creation
to God as much as to his own parents&mdash;to God ultimately,
to his parents proximately; (3) in both these respects the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
individual tendency to endow the Divinity with attributes
derived from the parents is greatly stimulated and reinforced
by the suggestive power of religious tradition, working through
the channels of direct teaching or of representation in language,
literature and art.</p>

<p>The correspondence between the divine and the human
<span class="sidenote">Remoter
ancestors as
divine parent
substitutes</span>
parent is one that, for these reasons among others, is very
deeply rooted in the human mind. In an advanced stage of
culture it may find its most natural expression in the related
concepts of an ultimate and an immediate creator respectively,
but at a more primitive mental level it is usually brought into
connection with the distinction between remoter ancestors and
immediate parents. There can be no doubt that the most
important aspects of the theory and practice of religion are
very largely derived from, and influenced by, ancestor worship,
even though they may not, as Herbert Spencer has contended<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>,
have entirely originated from this source. Granted the
fundamental assumption of animism&mdash;the existence of an individual
soul or spirit which is to some extent independent of
the body and may survive bodily death&mdash;it becomes easy to
attribute to one's dead parents or to one's remoter ancestors
powers that exceed those of persons who are still alive. There
is not, as in the case of the living, any obvious and well
defined limit to their capacity, and it becomes possible therefore
to displace freely on to them the exaggerated notions
which it is no longer possible to hold with regard to parents
who are still subject to the conditions of earthly existence.
The tendency which thus arises is reinforced by the very
general fear of the dead<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>, which easily attributes to its objects
an exaggerated power&mdash;especially for evil. The more remote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the ancestors in time, the more easy does it become to assign
to them a power which is manifestly superior to that of the
living, though the ideas of the ancestors and of their power
necessarily become at the same time more shadowy and vague.</p>

<p>The conditions are thus given for a religion of simple
<span class="sidenote">Unsatisfying
features of
simple
ancestor
worship</span>
ancestor worship, such as has existed in very many parts of
the world<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and has often continued to exist alongside of a
wider state religion, as for instance in Rome. As a rule
however a further step is involved, probably because a simple
ancestor worship of this kind is both too indefinite and too
individualistic to prove permanently satisfactory, either from the
point of view of the individual himself or of the community
of which he forms a part. It is too indefinite because it does
not provide any sufficiently clear and characteristic object or
objects upon which the displaced parent-regarding feelings can
be directed; and it is too individualistic because, so long as
each family is thrown back solely upon its own ancestors as
objects of worship, the religious feelings and tendencies aroused
lack the stimulating force which they derive from the co-operation
of the herd instinct (in virtue of which the individual is particularly
liable to be affected by the emotions to which his
fellows give expression)<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> and through which alone, in many
cases, religion is able to become a permanent and stable form
of expression for the displaced parent-regarding tendencies of
childhood and a social force which has proved to be of the
greatest importance in the history and development of mankind.</p>

<p>For these and other reasons, ancestor worship is not often
<span class="sidenote">The All-Father</span>
found in its pure and simple form, but is usually complicated
and modified in at least two important ways:&mdash;(1) a single
ancestor is selected as the originator and founder of the family,
the high patriarchal attributes being for the most part reserved
for him alone; (2) this same ancestor is regarded as the
founder, not merely of a single family, but of the whole clan,
tribe, nation or other social unit, or, by a further extension,
of the whole human race, of all living beings or, ultimately, of
the whole Universe. There is thus created the notion of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
single All-Father, who serves at once as the supreme and
most satisfying embodiment of the father-ideal for the individual
and as a potent means of strengthening and uniting the community
through the sense of brotherhood and loyalty that
attaches to a common worship and a common origin from a
divine ancestor. The satisfying character of the religious concept
that is here reached is apt to be still further increased
by a complete or partial fusion of the notion of the divine
father with that of the kingly father which we have already
discussed. The mythical divine ancestor, the founder of the
race, is frequently supposed to have been originally a king
also, and it is usual for the reigning line of sovereigns to trace
their descent more especially from him. Very often too the
kings, or at any rate the greater ones among them, receive
divine honours at their death, being then worshipped along
with the other illustrious ancestors of the tribe, having but
exchanged their earthly power for a more exalted throne in
heaven.</p>

<p>It is in the early stages of tribal ancestor worship of the
<span class="sidenote">Totemism</span>
kind we have been here considering that we come across a
widespread social and religious system so curious in nature
that it may undoubtedly rank as one of the most remarkable
discoveries brought about by the study of primitive man.
I refer, of course, to Totemism. In Totemism the mythical
ancestor takes on a non-human form, being as a rule some
animal, but sometimes also a plant or even an inanimate
object. All examples of the totem class are, as a rule, held
sacred by those who belong to the respective totem, and must
be treated with care and reverence, but (in the case of animal
<span class="sidenote">Exogamy</span>
totems at any rate) are sometimes killed and eaten at a solemn
sacrificial feast. Combined with these religious or quasi-religious
manifestations of Totemism there are usually to be found
certain well marked features of social organization. A single
totem is not, as a rule, common to a whole tribe, but each
tribe consists of two or more (most often four, but sometimes
as many as eight) totem clans, which are all strictly exogamous,
no man being allowed to take a wife from his own clan; the
field of choice being indeed sometimes still further restricted,
in such a way that the women of only one small section of
the total tribe are available for this purpose. The sociological<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and psychological influences that led to the creation of the
totemic system in a number of widely separated parts of the
world are still to a large extent a matter of dispute. A number
of theories have been propounded on the subject, and although
many of them are suggestive, there is perhaps no single one
as that fully and satisfactorily accounts for all the facts<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>. Among
<span class="sidenote">The totem as
a father</span>
the few points that emerge clearly from the investigations and
discussions to which the matter has given rise is the connection
of the totem with the father. It has been shown that the
totem spirit regularly, either to a complete or to a partial extent,
plays the father's part in the creation of the child; the
substitution of totem for father being rendered easier by the
existence of a confused and ignorant state of mind on the
subject of paternity; which makes it conceivable that the spirit
of an animal or other object should enter into the mother's
womb and thus produce conception<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>.</p>

<p>That this vagueness on the subject of paternity in the
mind of primitive man finds its counterpart even in civilised
societies<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> is shown by the many legends of a supernormal
birth in which the father is dispensed with or is replaced by
some non-human being<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>. The deep rooted and persistent nature
<span class="sidenote">Relics of
Totemism in
religion</span>
of the tendency to totemism is shown also by the very frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
occurrence at all stages of culture of theriomorphic gods, whose
cult often leads to certain animals or classes of animals being
regarded as sacred, just as in the case of totemic communities.
Even when the gods are no longer habitually regarded as
animals, they still occasionally take on animal form (<em>cp.</em> the
frequent animal disguises of Zeus) or are connected with, or
represented by, animal symbols (<em>cp.</em> the dove, the pelican, the
<span class="sidenote">and in the
individual
mind</span>
lamb, the fish and the ass in Christianity). In the individual
mind of the civilised person animals are frequently utilised as
symbols of the parents in dreams and other productions of the
Unconscious<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>. There are indeed persons who experience a
peculiar fascination for some kind of animal, which they regard
with mixed feelings among which love, admiration, awe, disgust
and hate are often to be found; those emotions usually predominating
which are most prominent in the individual's relations
to his father. Thus in one case well known to the present
writer, in which the ideas connected with the father were
chiefly those of goodness and wisdom, the hostile aspects being
much repressed, the owl was looked upon very much in the
light of an individual totem, the solemn stare and pouting
figure of the bird appearing to symbolise the kindly beneficence
and immense wisdom of the (earthly and heavenly) father&mdash;with
just so much of mystery and possibility of evil as to add a
tinge of awe and horror to the total attitude. Freud<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> and
Ferenczi<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> have each reported interesting cases in this connection,
in both of which the father-regarding tendencies and emotions
had become displaced on to a particular kind of animal (in
one case the horse, in the other the fowl) with the result that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
this animal exercised an intense and persistent fascination, in
which opposing elements of love and hate could clearly be
distinguished<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.</p>

<p>If, as thus seems probable, we have in Totemism a peculiar
<span class="sidenote">The psychological
connection
between
Totemism
and
Exogamy</span>
form of displacement of the feelings originally directed to the
parents (and especially the father), it is not surprising that
Totemism should be frequently accompanied by manifestations
of the other, and sexual, aspect of the Œdipus complex. Such
manifestations are, in effect, not far to seek and are in all
probability to be found in the system of Exogamy which almost
invariably accompanies the institution of Totemism. Whether
or not Exogamy is co-eval with Totemism (some authorities
think that it is of later origin), there is now a very fair measure
of agreement that Exogamy has (consciously<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> or unconsciously)
been created as a means of avoiding incest. If this view is
correct it would appear that the connection between Totemism
and Exogamy (a connection the nature of which had for long
been anything but clear) is due to the fact that the two
institutions have respectively come into being as the result of
the operation of two closely-joined psychic factors, namely the
two principal elements of the Œdipus complex. Just as in the
individual mind, the presence in any high degree of one of
these elements tends to bring about the presence of the other,
so too in societies, the manifestations of the one element
tend to be closely correlated with the manifestations of the
other<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>.</p>

<p>In touching on the subject of Exogamy, we have come
very near to the most fundamental sociological problems
connected with the main theme of this book. To these problems
and to the whole question of the meaning of Exogamy we shall
return in a later chapter. For the moment we must leave
them, in order to pass on to the consideration of certain other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
aspects of the influence upon religion of psychic tendencies
connected with the family.</p>

<p>We have seen that the child's attitude towards his father
<span class="sidenote">The ambivalent
attitude
towards
the father as
reflected in
religion</span>
is usually an ambivalent one, <em>i. e.</em> it is determined partly by
tenderness and affection and partly by hostility or fear.
Naturally the relative predominance of one or other motive
varies from one case to another, both as regards the religious
life of individuals and as regards the beliefs and forms of
worship adopted by various races, nations, sects or denominations.
Thus the paternal qualities ascribed to the deity are
sometimes derived chiefly from that attitude of the child towards
its father in virtue of which it sees in him a being full of helpful
wisdom and tender pity, to whom it can turn for encouragement,
guidance and assistance in the difficult affairs of life,
and especially in times of trouble; sometimes on the other
hand more emphasis is laid upon those aspects of the father
in which he appears as a severe and perhaps cruel master or
tyrant who enforces strict obedience to his harsh commands
and who inflicts dire penalties upon all who dare to oppose
his wishes or defy his laws. In the higher forms of religion
the more directly hostile relations between child and parent
are seldom openly manifested, the conception of the father as
wicked or immoral tending to disappear with increasing culture,
though the notion of obedience to a stern, relentless authority
may be maintained. This in its turn however frequently gives
place to the idea of the kindly, helpful and forgiving father,
according to a process of development which in many respects
appears to resemble the evolution of thought as regards the
relations of the individual to the state or the king, to which
we have already drawn attention. It is a change of this nature
for instance that, more perhaps than all else, marks the step
from Judaism to Christianity; the latter giving promise of a
reign of kindliness and forgiveness in place of the harsh and
uncompromising exercise of paternal authority so characteristic
of the former. It is for this reason that Christianity (at any
rate in its primitive form) especially appealed to and encouraged
the poor, the weak and the helpless, those who were most in
need of kindness and assistance; and by so doing has encountered
the opposition or contempt of those who see the
paternal authority (and therefore its projection as the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the Universe) in a sterner shape<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>, or of those who (like
Nietzsche's Supermen), in their own sense of power and independence,
despise all who, as though they were still children,
require the assistance of a beneficent father to help them
through their lives.</p>

<p>In polytheistic religions, or those with polytheistic tendencies,
<span class="sidenote">The splitting
up of parental
attributes
among two or
more divinities</span>
the different paternal qualities may be divided among a
number of divinities; though as a rule there is a single
heavenly father who combines in his person the most exalted
aspects of creative and paternal power. Especially frequent is
the splitting up of what appear to be the desirable and undesirable
aspects of the father and the attribution of them to
distinct deities, so that a kind, benevolent, forgiving and protecting
divinity, upon the one hand, is contrasted with a stern,
wicked and cruel one upon the other. The mediaeval conception
of the Devil corresponds for instance, as has been shown by
<span class="sidenote">The Devil</span>
Ernest Jones<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> in his suggestive work upon this subject, to a
deity thus obtained by the splitting off of the evil attributes
of the father; a deity upon whom hatred, fear and even contempt
may be freely poured and who can conveniently be
made responsible for men's ill deeds and evil thoughts<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
attitude towards the heavenly father being correspondingly
purged of these undesirable features. The process of duplication,
which is frequently operative in other fields than that of religion,
<span class="sidenote">The
dissociation of
good and evil
in theology and
in the individual
mind</span>
particularly in those of myth and legend<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> arises of course as
a consequence of the psychical antagonism and resulting dissociation
between the love and the hate attitudes towards the
father, and can easily be made use of in religion owing to the
general correspondence that may appear to exist between the
benevolent and malevolent aspects of the all-powerful parent
and the equally inexplicable and uncontrollable aspects of the
natural forces to which the adult human being is exposed. In
this way both the love and the hate elements in the primitive
levels of the mind have relatively free play without becoming
involved in moral or emotional conflicts or in intellectual
contradiction; the double (ambivalent) mental attitude being
projected so as to form a dualistic principle of the Universe.</p>

<p>Although of all the members of the family, the father, as
<span class="sidenote">The mother regarding
feelings in
religion</span>
its head, most frequently and regularly undergoes apotheosis,
the other members of the family are not without considerable
influence on the conceptions that are formed as to the nature
and qualities of divine beings. Foremost as regards such
influence, after the father, is of course the mother. In a strict
monotheism the mother elements would seem to be almost
always, if not invariably, subordinate to those of the father; the
former, so far as they are represented at all, being submerged
or incorporated into the latter<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>. But very few religions remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
strictly and consistently monotheistic; and in most of those that
show tendencies towards polytheism the mother elements are
represented in a separate person or a separate principle. Thus,
both in primitive and in more advanced forms of religion it is
usual to find mother goddesses who bear the same relation to
the earthly mother as does the father-god to the earthly
father.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it would appear that the mother-goddess is,
<span class="sidenote">The mother-son
relationship
and its
repression</span>
at a certain stage of culture at any rate, liable to meet with
opposition from which the corresponding father-god is usually
exempt. This opposition would seem to be due to the admixture
of incestuous passion which is brought over into religion from
the original attachment of the child (and especially of course
the son) to his earthly mother. The relations between mother
and son fairly often find expression in religious stories, as in the
cases of Cybele and Attis, Ishtar and Tammuz, Mary and Christ
and (in the displaced form of brother and sister love) Isis and
Osiris. As a rule however the mother-son relationship is not
permanent but is disturbed and broken by evil plottings and
brutal actions on the part of some third person (usually a
father or a brother substitute), as a result of which the young
son-god often meets with his death. The relations of Attis and
of Christ to their mothers are of special interest in this
connection, inasmuch as they plainly indicate the existence of
an inner inhibition on the son's part as well as a separation
brought about by interference from without. Attis according
at least to some versions of his story, unmans himself on
discovering the incestuous nature of his affection (as Œdipus
himself had done, in a symbolic form, by putting out his eyes).
In Christ the repression of the mother-regarding tendencies
seems to have led to an attitude of aloofness towards his
mother, and through her towards all women (<em>cp.</em> his words
"Woman, what have I to do with thee?," John 2, 4)&mdash;an
attitude that has profoundly affected his followers throughout
the ages: for in the history of the Christian religion there is
<span class="sidenote">The struggle
round
the mother
element in
Christianity</span>
evidence&mdash;even apart from its notorious aversion from and
distrust of women in general&mdash;of the existence of a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
struggle centering round the idea of the divine mother. In the
early days of the Church there are accounts and rumours of
sects which endeavoured to establish the worship of Mary
alongside that of the Father and the Son, and there is evidence
to show that the notion of the Holy Ghost corresponds in one
of its aspects to that of a female deity who completes the
natural trinity of Father, Mother and Son<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>. In the Roman
Church Mary, as the mother of Christ, has received a widespread
and often profound (though to some extent of course unofficial)
adoration, being regarded perhaps especially as the helper in
time of trouble, to whom men and women may go for comfort,
protection, guidance or forgiveness in just the same way as
they did to their earthly mother in their childhood: an adoration
which has tended to call forth a feeling of disgust and horror
in the Protestant Church, in which the more primite Christian
tradition of the repression of the mother-regarding feelings has
in this respect been kept alive<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>The doctrine of the Immaculate Conception, which has
<span class="sidenote">The
Immaculate
Conception</span>
played such a prominent part in Christian theology and
theological discussion, is of course only one of the many
similar instances of the notion of the supernatural birth<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>. Like
many of these other instances, it is due, not merely to the fact
of its being a relic from a time when there was little certainty
or knowledge as to the nature of paternity, but to the fact
that it constitutes an active expression of a strong (though
usually unconscious) wish&mdash;a wish that is compounded from
a number of separate, though of course related, elements, of
which the chief are perhaps the following:&mdash;(1) the desire for
"purity" on the part of the mother, in order that she may
belong to the revered rather than to the sexually attractive
but despised group of women (<em>cp.</em> above p. 110)&mdash;a desire
which at the same time purifies the mother-regarding love of
its grosser elements and renders it less liable to repression;
(2) the desire to be independent of the father and to owe
nothing to him (<em>cp.</em> above p. 109); (3) a desire to avoid sexual
jealousy of the father together with the envy, hostility or
contempt that would inevitably&mdash;especially in view of the
general Christian attitude towards sex&mdash;accompany the notion
of the father as a sexually active being. These factors combine
to make the idea of sexual relations between the parents one
that is peculiarly distasteful to their children, particularly when
it is a question not of ordinary human parents with their
admitted imperfections but of their heavenly and perfected
counterparts, and the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception
satisfactorily removes the necessity for this idea<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>.</p>

<p>In more primitive forms of religion the correspondence of
<span class="sidenote">Open
depiction of
the parents
and of the
Œdipus
complex in
primitive
religions</span>
the heavenly family to the earthly family and the projection
on to the former of the feelings and tendencies aroused in
connection with the latter (and particularly those which enter
into the Œdipus complex) can as a rule be even more clearly
and unmistakably observed. Thus in primitive cosmogonies<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
there are usually two world parents whose relations to each
other are disturbed by their children, the son as a rule becoming
hostile to the father, deposing him from his position of
authority, killing or unmanning him or separating him from
the mother. Of these world parents the father is very frequently
regarded as a personification of the heavens, while the mother
is <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'indentified'">identified</ins> with the Earth<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>; Heaven and Earth being sometimes
considered as having been separated by their children
from the close embrace in which they had previously been
lying (as in the case of Atlas, who in this way keeps Heaven
apart from Earth&mdash;a story which has many parallels, especially
in Polynesian Mythology). In the Greek version Ouranos and
Gaia (of whom the latter seems to have been the mother of
the former, their union being thus incestuous) are separated
by their son Cronos, who, at the instigation of his mother,
deposes and castrates his father and marries his sisters Cybele,
the mother of the gods. In the next generation these barbarous
relations between parents and children are repeated. Cronos,
fearing that he in his turn will become a victim to the same
treatment as that which he himself had accorded to his father,
endeavours to escape the threatened danger by eating his children
as soon as they are born. Zeus however, being saved by a
stratagem of his mother, performs the very act which his father
had sought to prevent, and himself becomes firmly seated on
the throne of Heaven and is married to his sister Hera.</p>

<p>In primitive myths of this kind we see the hostile relations
<span class="sidenote">Indications of
mental conflict
and repression</span>
between successive generations displayed crudely and nakedly,
without any attempt at disguise or concealment. In others,
probably dating from a more cultured epoch, there are signs
of a mental conflict, the hostile actions being no longer performed
with the same singleness of purpose and freedom from
inhibition, but being accompanied by indications of a sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
guilt, or of an ability to understand or sympathise with the
opponent's point of view. In the battle of the Titans against
Zeus, some of the former fought on the side of the gods (<em>i. e.</em>
<span class="sidenote">Rebellion and
punishment</span>
defended their parents) and those who rebelled against the
paternal power were in the end defeated and punished (though
the punishment itself may sometimes&mdash;by a piece of over-determination&mdash;constitute
a continuation of the rebellious deed,
as in the above-mentioned case of Atlas); Adam and Eve, on
transgressing the divine prohibition to eat of the tree of knowledge
(<em>cp.</em> the forbidden question motive, p. 104) are turned out
of Eden; the builders of the Tower of Babel (<em>cp.</em> the attempt
to storm Heaven by Otos and Ephialtes in Greek mythology)
likewise meet with disaster; and in the noble story of
Prometheus, who stole the fire<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> from Heaven to benefit mankind,
the offender is brought into conflict with the father from
the highest motives and bears his punishment with a resignation
and fortitude that places him among the most splendid figures
in Greek tragedy.</p>

<p>Christ himself is only one of the last of the long line of
filial insurgents, substituting as he does, to a considerable extent,
the milder rule of the Son for the harsher regime of the
Judaic Father-God. In so doing he surrenders his life, thus
suffering the penalty which, in one form or another, overtook
his predecessors. In his case however, as in theirs, the penalty
itself is over-determined. Christ dies:&mdash;in the first place, as a
scapegoat, taking upon himself the guilt of his brothers and
hence becoming the saviour of mankind, who are by his
sacrifice freed from the consequences of their equal guilt<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>;
secondly, as one who suffers the talion punishment for the
original sin of the son towards the father, the guilt attaching
to the death of the father being wiped out by the death of the
son; thirdly, by this very sacrifice manifesting his divine nature
and raising himself to a place alongside the father, thus
ultimately pointing the way to a reconciliation between father
and son (a reconciliation that is already hinted at in the story
of Prometheus).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only religious beliefs, but many religious rites, ceremonies
<span class="sidenote">Family
influences in
religious rites
and practices</span>
and practices may be shown to be connected with the
ideas, feelings and tendencies which centre round the family.
We have already seen how the rite of baptism (besides of
course its significance as a purification or washing away of
sin)<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> is linked on to the ideas of re-birth and initiation, with
<span class="sidenote">Baptism and
Confirmation</span>
all that these imply (<em>cp.</em> above Chs. VIII and IX). Still more
intimately connected with the idea of initiation, and corresponding
to the initiation ceremonies that are performed at the time of
adolescence in so many parts of the world, is the Christian
sacrament of Confirmation; which can, appropriately enough,
only be conducted by a senior member of the Church (father
representative).</p>

<p>Of particular interest in this connection is the central rite
<span class="sidenote">The
Communion</span>
of the Christian Church&mdash;the sacrament of the Communion<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>,
which has connections with the practices and beliefs of
Totemism, with the widespread religious rite of sacrifice and
with the relations between father and son to which we have
just had occasion to refer.</p>

<p>Although Totemism is by many authorities supposed to
<span class="sidenote">Totemic and
sacrificial
elements in the
Communion</span>
have been foreign to the culture and religions of those peoples
from whom western civilisation has chiefly sprung, Robertson
Smith has brought much evidence to show that many of the
religious and social practices of the Semitic races bear traces
<span class="sidenote">Their psychological
significance</span>
of totemic origin<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>. Among these not the least important are
those connected with sacrifice&mdash;animal and human. In animal
sacrifice the slaughtered animal was originally regarded as a
kinsman<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>; it was also at the same time related to or identified
with the god who protected the animal and in whose honour
the animal was slain<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>; it was also in many cases regarded
with mingled feelings of reverence and horror very similar to
those with which the totem animal is often looked upon<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>, the
Semitic concept of Uncleanness corresponding closely to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>Polynesian notion of Taboo. In these respects we have a
striking resemblance to Totemism as practised in more primitive
communities.</p>

<p>Now we have seen that the totem animal is, in one of its
most important aspects, a father surrogate. The slaying of the
totem animal, therefore, ultimately represents the murder of
the father; at the same time the slaughtered animal represents
a sacrifice in honour of the father and a gift to him. We have
here an example of the ambivalent attitude towards the totem-father;
the father, as the God to whom the sacrifice is offered,
is honoured and regarded with affection; the father, as the
animal, is cruelly killed. At the same time the victim would
appear in another aspect to stand as a substitute for the son
who, as we have seen, may be slain instead of the father,
atoning by his own death for the intended or wished-for
murder of the father.</p>

<p>As regards the eating of the sacrifice, it may perhaps in
one respect be regarded as the consummation of the hostile
act. Cronos eats his children in order to be sure of getting
rid of them; and the swallowing of children or even of grown
men by an ogre, giant, monster or witch is a not uncommon
theme in folklore. The eating of the parents by the children
in their turn is a natural and obvious form of revenge; and
has actually been practised by some primitive people<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>.</p>

<p>At the same time eating may be regarded as an honour
or as a sign of affection; as is necessarily to some extent the
case, since the totem animal represents the god and is itself
as a rule sacred and inviolable except in certain circumstances.
This aspect indeed obviously plays a part of great importance
in the Christian sacrament in its present form<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>.</p>

<p>The most important aspect of all however is that in virtue
of which the eater is supposed to acquire or to participate in
the nature, qualities or properties of that which is eaten, the
worshipper thus becoming one with the God whose flesh and
blood he consumes; in this way at one and the same time:&mdash;(a)
himself acquiring directly some of the qualities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
divinity, (b) becoming assured of his kinship with God, the
common meal being regarded as the especial symbol of this
kinship (as indeed of kinship in general)<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>, (c) becoming likewise
assured of his kinship with his fellow worshippers, all
becoming brothers by participation in the divine meal and in
the underlying ideas&mdash;including of course the original father
hatred and the atonement for this&mdash;which this meal implies.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the food which is consumed in the
Communion represents:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) the Father</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) as hated and killed,</p>

<p>(b) as honoured.</p></blockquote>

<p>(2) the Son, as slain to atone for the father-murder and
offered up in honour to the Father.</p>

<p>The actual consumption of the food represents:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) the eating of the Father</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(a) as a sign of hostility,</p>

<p>(b) as a sign of honour or affection,</p>

<p>(c) as a means of partaking of the divine nature (<em>i. e.</em>
acquiring the father attributes).</p></blockquote>

<p>(2) the eating of the Son, as a means of establishing
identity with him and thus sharing in the atonement which he
has made by his sacrifice.</p>

<p>(3) the establishment of a sense of communion and of
kinship between the fellow worshippers themselves and between
them and the deity, through participation in the divine meal
with all that this implies.</p>

<p>We thus see that, as regards both religious beliefs and
<span class="sidenote">The influence
of family
tendencies in
religion</span>
religious practices, the emotions, feelings and tendencies
originally aroused in connection with the family play a part of
great importance. The gods in whose form man has personified
the natural forces of the Universe, or whom he has himself
called into being, are to a very large extent projections of the
infantile conceptions of the parents&mdash;beings whom he has
created in his phantasy to serve as objects on to whom might
be transferred that part of what remains of his primitive attitude
towards the parents which has found no adequate sublimation
on to living human beings. Sometimes the phantasy is
worked out entirely in the dramatic form, the desires and
tendencies connected with the family finding their projected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
expression in the behaviour of the divine beings. It is for this
reason that the conduct of the gods is, from the moral standpoint,
often below rather than above the human standard; the
crude and primitive wishes belonging to the infancy of the
individual and the race, wishes that so far as adult and civilised
life is concerned have been outgrown or at least repressed and
held in check, finding a relatively unobstructed outlet in the
(usually archaic) forms and ritual of religion. At other times
it is only the figures of the gods themselves that are projected,
the worshipper remaining himself in intimate contact with
them through a relationship which represents a sublimated
form of that which existed between child and parent.</p>

<p>In spite of its basis in primitive infantile fixations, there
<span class="sidenote">Value of
religion as a
form of
displacement</span>
can of course be no doubt that religion has performed a work
of very great value in the history of human culture. Both in
the case of the individual and in that of the race the displacement
of the primitive tendencies directed towards members of
the family has been, as we have seen, a matter of the greatest
importance, but at the same time of the greatest difficulty, in
the history of mental and moral development. The provision
of a suitable outlet for those parts and aspects of the tendencies
in question which could find no adequate object among living
human beings was of itself no mean service. The establishment
of a moral authority which should stand in the same relation
to adult men as parents do to children, thus affording a higher
sanction for morality than could otherwise be obtained under
primitive conditions; the solidification of the social bond
between neighbours and fellow tribesmen, through the consciousness
of a common worship and a common parentage
from the same divine ancestor; the utilisation of the
exaggerated and idealised notions that had been formed concerning
the parents in early childhood, to create the concept
of a being of more than human virtue, a being who enjoined
the nearest possible approach to his own divine perfection on the
part of his human followers, thus contributing in no small measure
to the raising of the level of morality; the confirmation (through
the idealised and sublimated love of the divine parents) of the stage
of object-love as contrasted with the lower stage of Narcissism<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the stimulation of interest in natural forces, objects and events
by endowing them with the strong emotional tone originally
connected with the parents; these are some (and only some)
of the benefits which humanity has derived from the displacement
of the primitive parent-regarding feelings that is
involved in religion.</p>

<p>It is easy of course to point to the numerous evils that
religion has directly or indirectly brought about; conservatism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
intolerance, persistent opposition to the progress of scientific
or unprejudiced thought, the fostering of manifold delusions
and absurdities, the retention of vast masses of mankind in
superstitious fear and ignorance when they should have been
acquiring confidence and knowledge. In spite however of these
and of the many other very serious charges that may be brought
against it, religion can claim to have played a very necessary
and beneficial rôle in the past history of culture. Sublimation
is, as we have seen, a process that works slowly and by finely
graduated steps, so that neither in the individual nor the race
can we expect to see far-reaching moral transformations rapidly
and easily achieved. The feelings and tendencies of the child
in relation to the family environment are in many of their
aspects so primitive and crude and yet so powerful and
persistent, that we must welcome gladly any means of displacement
that has proved itself of value to the individual and to Society.
It is for this service, above all others, that we are indebted to
religion in the past.</p>

<p>As regards the future, it is evident that the needs of
<span class="sidenote">The future of
religion</span>
humanity to which religion has ministered will, in some sense
at any rate, long continue to exist. The backward pull of the
tendencies of infancy and childhood, forming, as they do, the
foundation upon which all subsequent desires and aspirations
are built up; the closeness of the similarity between the
situation of the adult confronted with the vast and overwhelming
power of Nature and that of the child who helplessly depends
upon his parents both for happiness and life&mdash;these are influences
which may well continue to make religion in some form a
permanent necessity.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it would appear that the future progress of
human culture will demand a very considerable modification
and purification of most existing religious forms. The study of
the psychology of religion is showing that these forms are, for
the most part, based on crude unconscious motives which have
to be outgrown and superseded if civilisation is to prosper and
advance. In retaining and fostering these forms we are in many
cases playing into the hands, not of the higher, but of the
baser and more primitive aspects of our nature, aspects which,
at our present level of development, it is necessary indeed to
understand, but not to venerate or even to approve. Even in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
so far as the forms of religion give expression not so much to
the direct promptings of these baser aspects as to the reactions
we have formed against them, it must be remembered that true
moral advance lies in sublimation rather than in repression
and that so long as the human mind confines itself to the
purely negative task of opposing its own primitive tendencies,
it will never achieve either true emancipation or true
progress<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>.</p>

<p>Further, the study of religion shows that the conceptions
which religion has formed as to the nature and working of the
Universe have arisen as products of the human emotions, having
no necessary counterparts in the real world; much the same
indeed in this respect as the inventions of the fairy stories and
imaginative games of childhood or the day-dreams, romances
and novels of a later age. In adult life such phantasies must
either be abandoned or, if indulged in, recognised for what
they are&mdash;productions of the mind which, apart from objective
evidence, have no valid claim upon reality. They may indeed
guide us in our ideals and aspirations and so lead ultimately
to the reconstruction of the outer world through our own
efforts, but in themselves they must be held distinct from the
order of reality belonging to this outer world. Only so will
Man achieve his full stature and be able to play that part in
Nature's scheme of things to which, in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'virture'">virtue</ins> of his intellectual
powers and his moral aspirations, he appears to be entitled.</p>

<br />
THE ATTITUDE OF PARENTS TO CHILDREN</h2>


<p>In dealing thus far with the psychic aspects of the filio-parental
<span class="sidenote">The affective
reactions of
the parent
towards the
child</span>
relations in their origin, nature and development, we
have for the most part based our considerations on the standpoint
of the child rather than on that of the parent. Such a
course would seem to be justified from the genetic point of
view by the fact that every individual has first to be a child
before he can become a parent, and that consequently, though
his attitude as a parent is very liable to be influenced by his
experience as a child, there can be no corresponding influence
of a converse nature. As a matter of fact, however, we have,
in the course of our consideration of the psychic development
of the child in relation to the influences emanating from the
family, fairly often had occasion to concern ourselves at least
indirectly with the mental attitude of the parents as a factor
in this development.</p>

<p>Thus we have seen that the direction of the child's
affection to the parent of the opposite sex rather than to the
one of his own sex is probably determined largely by the
extent of the affection which the child in his turn receives from
the two parents respectively; the heterosexual inclinations of
the parents causing them on the whole, and in the absence of
any powerful factors tending to produce an opposite result, to
give their love most freely towards those of their children who
are of the opposite sex to their own. We have seen too that
the nature and duration of the feelings of envy, jealousy and
hate which a child is liable to experience towards one or other
of its parents are to a very considerable extent dependent on
the behaviour of this parent towards the child. It is evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
also from our previous considerations that there is likely to
be a quantitative as well as a qualitative correspondence between
the love and hate which a child may feel towards its parents
and the manifestation of corresponding emotions in the parents
themselves. All that is left for us to do in this direction is to
look a little more closely into some of the factors which
determine the nature and extent of the affective reactions of
the parent towards the child.</p>

<p>It is now pretty generally agreed among psychologists
<span class="sidenote">The instinctive
love of parents
to children</span>
that the love of parents to their children takes place in virtue
of the formation of a sentiment<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> or organisation of instinctive
dispositions about an idea (in this case the idea of the child),
and it is further usually supposed that in this sentiment a
leading part is played by a particular instinctive disposition&mdash;a
disposition which manifests itself in consciousness in an
emotion of more or less specific quality, to which McDougall,
following Ribot, has given the now familiar term "tender
emotion." Now there are clear indications that the energy
involved in this disposition (like that of all other instinctive
dispositions) can play a part&mdash;and normally does play a part&mdash;in
many other sentiments besides that which is concerned in
<span class="sidenote">The love of
parents to
children stands
in reciprocal
relationship to
the parents'
other interests
and affections</span>
the love of a parent towards his (or her) child. For this reason
the emotional outflow along the lines of this latter sentiment
varies to some extent in inverse proportion to the outflow
along the lines of other sentiments. Thus the amount of love
which a parent can bestow upon a child is limited by the
amount of the affection and interest which he bestows upon other
persons and other things. The parent who has no other occupation
in life than the care of his or her children is usually bound
to these children by emotional ties of a much closer, more
intimate and more intensive nature than is one whose energies
are partially absorbed by outside interests and occupations. The
parent of a single child will, as a rule, be more strongly attached
to that child than the parent of many children will be to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
one of his. Again, the parent whose sexual emotions and tendencies
have but little opportunity for discharge will be apt to
lavish a greater amount of affection on his children than one
who is leading a more active sexual life. Thus it is that widowers,
widows and those who are unhappily married<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> frequently
display a more than normal degree of attachment to their
children, the latter receiving, in <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'addititon'">addition</ins> to the love that would
ordinarily fall to their share, the displaced affection which
would otherwise find its outlet in the love of wife or husband.
For this reason the tie between such parents and their children
is apt to be more than usually close; and all psychological
characteristics which are produced by such a tie will occur
more readily in these cases than in others. In order to avoid
this emotional overloading of the filio-parental tie, it will
usually be necessary for such parents to find compensation
elsewhere for the energy which cannot be directed to its normal
goal, and for the measures undertaken with a view to the prevention
of undue fixation of the children's love upon their
parents to be prosecuted with more than usual care and energy.</p>

<p>The fact that the love available for offspring and for spouse
<span class="sidenote">The consequent
jealousy
between
parent and
child</span>
respectively stand thus to some extent in reciprocal relation to
one other, renders inevitable a certain amount of competition
for this love, whenever the demands from both sides are strong
and persistent. We have already seen how from this source
jealousy may arise in the child towards the parent of his or
her own sex. A similarly conditioned jealousy will often arise
also in the parent, though in this case the hostile feelings will
frequently be confined to the Unconscious and will be discoverable
only indirectly through their manifestations or through
a process of analysis. This jealousy may nevertheless be
productive of much harm in family life; and, when present in
high intensity, may lead to permanent estrangement and
bitterness between parents and children just as surely as may
corresponding feelings on the part of the child.</p>

<p>Just as in the case of children the hostile emotions towards
<span class="sidenote">Conflicting
interests of
parents and
children</span>
the parents that arise from jealousy are liable to be powerfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
reinforced by those due to more general interference with the
child's desires, so too in the case of the parents, any ill-feelings
that they may bear towards their children as a result of
jealousy are likely to be complicated by other causes of
hostility. If it be to some extent inevitable that children should
come to regard their parents as obstacles to the full attainment
of their own desires and as unwelcome causes of interference
with their most cherished activities, parents have at least equal
reason to complain similarly of their children. The responsibility,
<span class="sidenote">The sacrifices
involved in
parenthood</span>
the effort, the anxiety, involved in rearing children,
diminish very considerably the time and energy available for
more directly personal occupations and enjoyments. To some
extent the individual inevitably sacrifices himself in becoming
a parent, in accordance with the general biological law which
Spencer has designated the antagonism between individuation
and genesis; and this sacrifice of personal comforts, pleasures,
satisfactions and ambitions does not as a rule take place without
some degree of resentment being felt against those whose
existence necessitates the sacrifice. Even where&mdash;owing to
robust health, abundant energy, ample means, state relief or
other circumstances&mdash;children demand but little sacrifice of the
major aims and occupations of life, the very considerable
difference between the points of view of children and those
of adults and the largely incompatible nature of the conditions
and activities that appeal to their respective minds tend to
make the constant presence of children, especially within the
confines of a small home, inevitably to some extent a cause of
annoyance to the parents. As Bernard Shaw<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> so well points
out, children are indeed to some extent necessarily and unavoidably
a nuisance to grown-up persons; with their illregulated
and impulsive energy and their disregard of the
habits and conventions to which their seniors have become
accustomed, they constitute an ever present menace to the
comfort and tranquillity of adult life&mdash;a menace from which
even the most devoted parent must sometimes wish that he
could free himself.</p>

<p>The mother, owing to the greater demands which children
<span class="sidenote">Their influence
on the mother</span>
make upon her time and health and energy is perhaps that
one of the parents to experience most keenly such hostile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
feelings, though the existence of a strong counter-impulse
towards maternal love will often insure repression of these feelings
into the unconscious; so that it usually requires a process
of analysis to reveal the often strong resentment that a mother
may entertain towards the child who so seriously interferes
with her more directly individual needs and aspirations<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>.</p>

<p>The interference of children with the activities and desires
<span class="sidenote">On the father</span>
of the father is usually less direct and the ill-will which fathers
bear towards their children is therefore more apt to be aroused
in consequence of jealousy than is the corresponding feeling
of the mother. Nevertheless, in the case of the father too,
there almost always sooner or later arises some degree of
interference with his pleasure, his comfort, his work or his
ambitions; so that he feels that his children constitute a burden
which seriously hampers his individual progress or enjoyment.</p>

<p>The hostile feelings of parents towards their children which
<span class="sidenote">Identification
of the child
with its grandparent</span>
take their origin from one or more of these sources are often
powerfully stimulated and reinforced by an unconscious process
in virtue of which the child is identified with the parent's own
parent (the child's grandparent). This tendency to identify child
with grandparent is one which would seem to be deeply
implanted in the human mind<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>. Thus in several parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
world grandparents are supposed to become re-incarnated in
their grandchildren&mdash;a belief which is probably responsible for
the widespread practice (observed among others by the ancient
Greeks) of naming a child after its grandparent, especially in
the case of eldest sons who frequently receive the name of
their paternal grandfather<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>.</p>

<p>For the grounds of this belief and the tendencies which
<span class="sidenote">Causes of this
similarity of
parent-child to
previous
child-parent
relationship</span>
have given rise to it, it is probable that we must look to the
similarities between the relations of parent to child and those
which had existed a generation earlier between child and
parent. As we have just seen, the feelings that are liable to
be evoked by these relationships are in certain respects not
dissimilar, and it would appear as though the situation in which
an individual is placed when he becomes a parent serves to
call up in him some of the partially forgotten and partially
outgrown emotions and tendencies which he had experienced
in his own childhood and to direct them now upon his child
in the same way as he had formerly directed them upon his
parent. Thus the new position in which a father finds himself
in competition with his son for the affection of his wife revives
in the Unconscious a memory of the former situation in which
as a child he competed with his father for the love of his
mother.</p>

<p>The identification of child with grandparent would seem
to be helped also by the intimate connection with a curious
but not infrequent product of imagination which has been
called by Ernest Jones "the phantasy of the reversal of
<span class="sidenote">The "phantasy
of the reversal
of generations"</span>
generations<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>." According to this phantasy&mdash;to which attention
had also been called by psychologists other than those of the
psycho-analytic school, notably by Sully<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>&mdash;it is supposed that,
as children grow bigger and finally attain to adult stature, their
parents, as they increase in age, undergo a corresponding
diminution; so that eventually a complete reversal of size as
regards the two generations is attained, those who were once
parents being now reduced to a position very similar to that
of children, while the original children, through their increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
in size and power, are themselves able to behave in a quasi-parental
manner to their parents. The ultimate psychological
foundations of this quaint belief are as yet not clearly understood,
though it is fairly certain that the notions of personal
immortality and of metempsychosis, together with the great
emotional significance in the child's mind of the ideas connected
with bodily size, play an important part in this connection.
Whatever be the origin of this phantasy, the persistence of
some remnants of it in the Unconscious is admirably adapted
to serve as a means whereby an individual may identify his
children with his parents and then direct upon the former
the hostile emotions aroused in connection with the latter. The
fact that such an individual is now possessed of superior
strength and power, whereas formerly he had been relatively
weak and helpless, makes it tempting for him to use this
opportunity for taking revenge for the real or supposed injuries
he had suffered in his childhood<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>. In this way children are
liable to become sometimes the innocent victims of bullying or
nagging which, according to the principles of justice, are due
to their grandparents rather than to themselves. When
combined with a violent parent hatred, such identification of
children with their grandparents may take on tragic proportions
and lead to the direst consequences; and it is probable that
in the majority if not in all of those sad cases, where a parent
conceives a permanent and unreasoning antipathy to one or
more of his children, the foundations of the dislike are to be
found in such a combination of unconscious or semi-conscious
factors.</p>

<p>This process of identification is not however operative only
with regard to hatred. It may exert also a powerful influence
upon the direction of love and is often of special importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
where parents definitely select a favourite from among their
children, this favourite child being then invested with the love
that was formerly directed to the favourite parent<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>. For this
reason too parents may often be desirous that their children
should adopt the profession, mode of life, beliefs or habits of
their (the childrens') grandparents<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>.</p>

<p>In all cases where a parent resents the coming into being
<span class="sidenote">The effect of
parent-child
love on the
attitude of
parents to
each other</span>
or the presence of children, and especially in those where the
resentment is based largely upon jealousy, some degree of
displeasure is apt to be directed upon the other parent, who
is regarded as responsible for the existence of the unwelcome
intruder or as transferring to him an undue proportion of
attention and affection. In this respect the situation recalls in
the parents mind the earlier one in which, in his own childhood,
he resented the love of his parents for each other, and
in consequence of which the love which he himself bore to
one of his parents became converted into, or was mixed with,
hatred and contempt (<em>cp.</em> p. 110). Thus a father may experience
towards his wife something of those feelings of outraged
jealousy which he had formerly harboured towards his mother&mdash;a
resuscitation and transference of feelings of this kind being
rendered all the easier by the fact that his wife is very probably
already to some extent unconsciously identified with his mother,
so that the whole original situation is lived through again with
the substitution of wife for mother and of child (especially of
course in the case of a boy) for father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>It has recently been shown by Reik<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> that this last mentioned
<span class="sidenote">The Couvade</span>
factor of the resentment against the wife together with the
previously discussed jealousy and hatred of the child are capable
of throwing a very considerable amount of light upon certain
customs practised amongst primitive peoples upon the occasion
of the birth of a child&mdash;customs the origin and nature of which
it appears at first sight very difficult to understand. To these
customs we may well devote a brief consideration here, since
they seem peculiarly adapted to bring out some of the most
important aspects of the unconscious feelings of parents toward
their offspring and&mdash;incidentally&mdash;toward one another. The
customs in question are generally comprehended under the
single term Couvade and may be divided, following Frazer,
into two main groups:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) the pre-natal or pseudo-maternal Couvade, which aims
primarily and ostensibly at a magical transference of the mother's
labour pains on to the person of the father, the father pretending
to undergo what the mother experiences in reality;</p>

<p>(2) the post-natal or dietetic Couvade, in which the father
pretends to be weak or ailing for a certain time after the birth
of his child, during which time he keeps to his bed and
refrains from eating certain foods.</p>

<p>As regards the pre-natal Couvade, it is obvious that the
<span class="sidenote">The pre-natal
Couvade as an
expression of
ambivalent
feelings
towards the
wife</span>
occasion of his wife's labour is one which is liable to arouse
strong, and to some extent conflicting, emotions in the father.
The danger and distress to which the mother is exposed
naturally tend to arouse in the father feelings of sympathy and
anxiety together with a desire to help and to alleviate the
suffering to the best of his ability&mdash;an attitude which finds
expression in an attempt to transfer the pain according to the
principles of homoeopathic magic. At the same time the position
of the mother is such as to stimulate in the father any hostile
and cruel wishes he may entertain towards her, and, though
such wishes will generally be confined entirely or principally
to the Unconscious, they will usually be present in a greater
or a less degree; since, besides any general cause of hostility
and any tendency to Sadism (both of which are probably at
work to some extent), there is liable to occur the more specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
resentment connected with the bringing into existence of a rival,
who may usurp much of the mother's care and affection which
the father had hitherto enjoyed alone. There is reason to suppose
therefore that at certain levels of the father's mind there
is often present an actual enjoyment in the contemplation of
the mother's sufferings and even a wish that she may die. In
taking upon himself the mother's pains, the father is therefore,
at one and the same time, doing his best to help the mother,
subjecting himself to a talion punishment for desiring the
mother to feel pain, and placing himself in a position more
thoroughly to express and realise her suffering.</p>

<p>A similar attitude is indicated by the beliefs and practices
<span class="sidenote">The belief in
demons</span>
with regard to demons which are frequently found associated
with the Couvade. Demons are, from the psychological point of
view, merely projections of thoughts and tendencies of the unconscious
mind, and the demons who are supposed to be inflicting
pain upon the mother are therefore an expression of the
unconscious desire to inflict such pain. This desire manifests
itself also in not a few of the measures which are taken to drive
away the demons, measures which, though ostensibly undertaken
for the benefit of the mother are in reality calculated to cause
her fright, pain or discomfort, such as shooting, shouting, lighting
fires in her proximity, playing with swords or even beating her.</p>

<p>While the pre-natal Couvade is thus principally the manifestation
<span class="sidenote">The post-natal
Couvade results
principally
from hostile
feelings
towards the
child</span>
of repressed hostility towards the mother, the post-natal
Couvade would seem to arise chiefly as the result of a
similar attitude towards the child. This is shown by the fact
that the practices associated with this aspect of the Couvade
are held to be necessary for, or at least conducive to, the life
and health of the newly born infant, who is regarded as peculiarly
liable to be affected by injudicious behaviour on the
part of the father; it is also shown by the fact that the father
is often held responsible for any evil that may befall the child
during the first days of its existence; thus indicating an appreciation
of the real unconscious tendency of the father to do
the child some harm. As regards the prohibition of certain
foods, it would seem that this is ultimately traceable to a repression
of the tendency to kill and eat the child (and through
him the grandfather whom he represents) a tendency which we
considered in the last chapter, and one to which most, if not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
all, taboos on foods would appear in the last resort very largely
to depend. The father's imaginary illness is also to some extent
influenced by his hostile feelings against the mother:&mdash;negatively,
in that by keeping to his bed he is prevented from doing her
harm; positively, in that by compelling her to attend on him in
his pretended helplessness, he forces her to work at a time when
rest and freedom from trouble would have been more welcome.</p>

<p>Certain other students of the Couvade, such as Bachofen,
<span class="sidenote">The Couvade
as an assertion
of the father's
rights</span>
are probably to some extent right too in maintaining that the
practice represents an assertion by the father of his rights and
privileges, being connected thus with the transition from mother-descent
to father-descent. Certain it is that through the practice
the father emphasises his share of the parenthood and thus
effectually prevents any tendency to regard the mother as the
sole, or even as the chief, producer and guardian of the child.
In so doing, he also, we may suspect, endeavours to produce
a compensation for the lack of attention from which he might
otherwise suffer at this time, owing to the fact that the mother's
share of parenthood is at the moment of birth by nature so
much more prominent than that of the father.</p>

<p>This feeling of inferiority is frequently shared by fathers
<span class="sidenote">The
corresponding
attitude in
modern life</span>
in modern civilised societies, who at the birth of their children
are often unpleasantly impressed by their own uselessness and
unimportance, and are easily led to complain of neglect or
inattention, sometimes even going so far as unconsciously to
produce in themselves some more or less psycho-genetic malady,
in order to claim care and sympathy from those about
them and to prevent a too exclusive preoccupation with the
mother. In other ways too it is evident that many of the mental
tendencies which underlie the practices connected with the
Couvade are still rife in modern life. By his exaggerated excitement
and anxiety, a father will often betray the conflicting
nature of the emotions that beset him at the time of the birth
of his child; while the manifold crude superstitions and practices
and the numerous unreasonable beliefs and attitudes that
are connected with pregnancy and birth serve further to demonstrate
the archaic, and therefore fundamental, nature of the
ideas and feelings that centre round these events<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>The hostility which a parent may harbour towards his
child or children from the causes we have been considering
<span class="sidenote">Parent-child
hostility in
later life</span>
will, under happy conditions of individual and family development,
tend naturally to diminish as time passes and permits of
adjustment to the new circumstances occasioned by the existence
of the children. More especially of course, the feelings of
hatred and jealousy, which may originally have been aroused,
will usually be overcome, or at least adequately held in check,
by the feelings of parental love which are brought into play
by contact with the child and by the process of providing for
its needs. Even in the most devoted parents there usually
remains however some remnant of jealousy or resentment that
lurks in the Unconscious and can be detected by the process
of Psycho-Analysis. This is especially the case as regards the
relations of parents to the children of their own sex, where the
motive of jealousy is liable to be added to the other motives
that arise as a result of the sacrifices that have to be incurred
by the parent. In general however it may be safely asserted
that in no case does the very real antagonism that exists between
the activities and enjoyments of the father and mother as
individuals and as parents respectively fail to manifest itself in
some degree of mental conflict, and that in no case are the
hostile feelings against the children that result from this antagonism
entirely abolished from the mind.</p>

<p>As time proceeds and children grow up, two new factors
<span class="sidenote">New factors
influencing
the attitude
of parents
to children
in later life</span>
of great importance are liable to be added to those that
determine the attitude of parents towards their children,
although in many cases one or both of these factors may have
been present in germinal form from the beginning. Both factors
are connected with the biological truth that in the history
of the race the child is the natural successor and substitute
of the parent; but while having this much in common, they
differ markedly in their psychological and social nature
and effects, one factor tending to produce envy and hatred
towards the children, the other love, pride and joy in their
success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of these two factors consists in the unwelcome
<span class="sidenote">Envy
of childrens'
superiority</span>
realisation that the child will shortly be, or perhaps already is,
the equal or even the superior of the parent in certain of the
more important of life's aspects. Thus the father may become
painfully aware of the fact that he is being gradually but
certainly outmatched by his son in strength or skill or learning;
while the mother may similarly find herself becoming outrivalled
by her daughter in beauty, charm, accomplishments or intellectual
power. This awareness on the parent's part of the
increasing failure of their own powers relatively to those of
their children is naturally liable to increase the bitterness that
they may already feel towards their children for other reasons.
Just as the self-interests of the parents formerly caused them
to grudge the care, attention and effort which the existence of
the children demanded, so now their pride and self-love may
cause them to grudge their children that superiority which
nature in the course of time bestows upon them.</p>

<p>It might well seem indeed as though some degree of
<span class="sidenote">Parents'
identification
of themselves
with their
children</span>
ill-feeling on these grounds would be inevitable in all parents
in whom the self-regarding sentiments were strongly or even
normally developed. Fortunately however it would appear that
there exists a way by which the hatred and unhappiness
arising from this source can to a very large extent be converted
into feelings of an opposite and socially more satisfactory
character. It is here that there comes into play the second of
the two factors mentioned above. This factor consists of the
process whereby the parent identifies himself with his child,
as it were incorporates the child into his larger self and is
thus able to take pleasure in the increasing powers of the
child as if they were his own. We have already had occasion
to study the corresponding process of identification in the mind
of the child; the child tends naturally to identify himself with
his parents or their substitutes, seeking thereby an increase of
his own power and satisfaction. For precisely similar reasons
the parent, as old age approaches (and even before then), will
tend to identify himself with his child, endeavouring thus to
find compensation for the diminution of his own personal
capacity. Thus a father may regard the successes and failures
of his son in his scholastic and professional career with the
same personal interest, the same intimate emotional response<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
as if they were his own, while the mother often follows her
daughters' erotic ambitions and adventures, her matrimonial
and parental life with a similar intensity of feeling.</p>

<p>This identification plays moreover a further and perhaps
<span class="sidenote">This identification
as a means
of obtaining
immortality</span>
still more important part inasmuch as it affords a means of
overcoming the finality of individual death, and insures the
parent, through his children and ultimately through their descendants,
the nearest approach to material immortality that can
be hoped for here on earth. The love of children and interest in
their welfare which springs from the altruistic and object-loving
tendencies involved in the parental instincts may thus
become fused with the strongly egoistic tendencies grouped
together under the self-preserving and self-regarding instincts
and sentiments; that dearest and most powerful wish of the
individual, <em>qua</em> individual&mdash;the desire for immortality&mdash;thus
obtaining satisfaction in the same way and at the same time
as the strongest and most distinctive of all altruistic impulses&mdash;those
which minister to the needs of the race through the love
and care which is bestowed upon children by their parents.
A reconciliation of the egoistic and the altruistic, of the
personal and the racial trends, is thus brought about&mdash;a reconciliation
which may be of the greatest value to the individual,
to the family and to the larger social organism of which they
both form a part.</p>

<p>Not only is a parent capable of obtaining through his
children the satisfaction attendant upon a prolongation of his
own existence; he may also through them enjoy vicariously
benefits, privileges, successes and pleasures of which he himself
has been deprived or has failed to reap advantage. What
<span class="sidenote">Vicarious enjoyments of
children's
pleasures and
successes</span>
the pessimist von Hartmann has styled the third stage of
humanity's illusion with regard to the possibility of happiness&mdash;the
idea that the pleasures which we have ourselves failed
to find may nevertheless be enjoyed by those that come after
us&mdash;is nowhere more strongly rooted than in the minds of
parents when they think of the future of their offspring.
Whether the underlying hope be illusory or not, there can be
no doubt that many parents (and these on the whole of the
nobler minded sort) are willing to labour that their children
may enjoy the result of their efforts, to amass riches that their
children may have the power that wealth confers, or even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
acquiesce in personal failure, if only their children may thereby
be brought nearer to success.</p>

<p>This aspect of the process of identification is one which,
<span class="sidenote">Its sociological
significance</span>
we may very reasonably expect, will tend to play an increasing
rôle as mental development proceeds and men come to work
more and more with distant ends in view. If this expectation
is correct, the aspect in question is probably one of very great
biological and sociological importance, for even under present
conditions it is clearly of much value in stimulating effort and
in fostering thoroughness, far-sightedness and care. If a man
realises that on his labours are dependent not only his own
happiness and well being but those of his children and his
children's children, he possesses one of the highest but at the
same time one of the most efficient incentives to truly moral
conduct to which the developed human mind is open<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>In order that the benefits and compensations attendant
<span class="sidenote">The development
of the
child requires a
corresponding
readjustment
of the parents'
attitude</span>
upon an identification of this sort may be achieved, it is
necessary that there should take place a gradual change of
attitude towards the child on the part of the parent&mdash;a
change which is very necessary also upon other grounds. In
the fourth and fifth chapters of this book we studied the
manner in which the successful development of the child requires
an ever increasing degree of emancipation from the ties of
affection and dependence which bind him to the parent. The
proper carrying out of this emancipation requires a corresponding
loosening of the ties that bind the parent to the child,
involving a readjustment in the direction of the parent's
interests and affections. If the parent continues to lavish
on the child, as he grows up, the same amount of
attention and affection that he required in infancy, the
normal development of the child's love impulses is liable
to be very seriously impeded; and should the child, in spite
of this difficulty, attain the stage of directing his love outside
the family, the parent is bound to suffer disappointment at
what appears to him (or at least to his unconscious mind) to
be the thanklessness and faithlessness of his child, and to feel
jealousy and hatred towards the person who has supplanted
<span class="sidenote">This is as
necessary for
the parent as
for the child</span>
him in the child's affection. Similarly, should the parent too
long or too extensively afford protection to the child, exercise
authority over him or take over responsibility from him, the child
will inevitably find it difficult to acquire the necessary degree
of emancipation from the parent's care and jurisdiction; and
should he after all succeed in acquiring such emancipation, the
parent will certainly suffer as the result of being deprived all
too suddenly and unwillingly of the directive power over the
child which he had hitherto enjoyed, and of the outlet for his
interests and emotional tendencies, which the care of a child
had hitherto afforded. The extreme demands on the energies
and affections of the parents (particularly on those of the
mother) caused by the utter helplessness of the human infant
grow progressively less as the child develops. The natural
course of events demands therefore on the part of the parents
a gradual modification, redistribution and redirection of the
emotions and interests that centred round the child in its early
life; an undue prolongation of the tendencies natural to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
early days of parenthood must necessarily in the long run be
detrimental to the true interest both of child and parent.</p>

<p>Obvious as these considerations may well seem to be, the
<span class="sidenote">Difficulty and
importance
of this readjustment</span>
logical carrying out of the conclusions to which they point is
often far from easy. In practice it is often as hard for parents
to wean themselves from their primitive attitude towards their
children, as it is for the children themselves to acquire the
necessary mental and moral independence of their parents. The
intense and profound emotions stirred up in the parent by his
relation to the child are not readily displaced into any other
channel, and fixation at a level only suited to the early stages
of the filio-parental relation may easily result. The consequent
struggle of the parent to keep possession of the child gives
rise to some of the most serious and tragic problems of family
life. It is one of the chief causes of the friction that so often
exists between the older and younger generations of the same
family; it tends, as we have seen, to hamper the mental and
moral development of children and to foster in them psychical
conflicts which may produce permanently evil effects upon their
character: in the parents themselves it often favours selfishness
and real disregard for the children's welfare, under the guise
of altruistic tenderness and care; and finally it causes much unhappiness
to the parents when, as inevitably happens to some
extent, they observe that, in spite of all their efforts, their children
are in one manner or another drifting from them, as by coming
under the influence of friends who are outside the circle of the
parents' <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'acqaintance'">acquaintance</ins>, by the adoption of habits, interests or careers
that are opposed to family tradition, or by marriage to persons
who to the parents' eyes appear to be unsuitable<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>The question of marriage is, under existing conditions
<span class="sidenote">The attitude of
parents to the
marriage of
their children</span>
one of special importance in this connection, since nothing else
(with the exception perhaps of permanent separation in space)
tends to cut off individuals to an equal extent from the direct
influence and contact of their parents. Parents who ardently
desire to retain a strong influence over their children are
therefore as a rule opposed to the marriage of the latter, and
usually display marked antagonism to their sons or daughters-in-law:
an antagonism which is the source of very frequent
domestic unhappiness. Since the marriage of their children is however
in many cases difficult or impossible to avert, such parents
will often seek to minimise the disturbing effect of marriage by
arranging that their children shall live near them after marriage
or that they shall marry a partner whom they regard as
suitable. In estimating suitability for this purpose, they are
usually guided by the extent to which the partner in question
is likely to constitute a serious obstacle to the operation of
their own (the parents') influence. Hence it often comes about
that the persons selected are sexually unattractive, of weak
character or deficient in intellectual power<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The avoidance of the evils consequent upon the insufficient
<span class="sidenote">Means of avoiding
insufficient
parental
re-adjustment</span>
readjustment of the parents attitude towards their children
is one of the most pressing tasks of an enlightened hygiene
of family life. In the accomplishment of this task it would seem
that there are two factors which are of great importance: in
the first place, the happiness of the relationship between the
two parents themselves (for, as we have seen, it is especially
in cases when marriage is unsuccessful that there is likely to
be an excessive outflow of emotion in the direction of the
children); in the second place, the maintenance of outside
interests, hobbies or occupations throughout the period of
parenthood and the gradual reinforcement of such interests as
the growth of the children renders the demand upon the
parent's energy less extensive and continuous. Where the
circumstances in these two respects are satisfactory, they
usually permit of the necessary readjustment of parental
energies with the minimum of friction and suffering.</p>

<br />
ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF THE FAMILY TENDENCIES&mdash;HATE ASPECTS</h2>


<p>The descriptive portion of our task is now completed. We
<span class="sidenote">Recapitulation</span>
have traced, with such degree of detail as the scope of this
book has permitted, the growth within the individual mind of
some of the more important of those feelings and tendencies
which owe their origin and development to the relations of
the individual to the other members of his family. We have
seen how these feelings and tendencies are of fundamental
importance in the formation of individual character and how
they have also exercised a vast influence on social life and
social institutions. We have seen also that, throughout their
multitudinous transformations and ramifications, the tendencies
originally connected with the family preserve some likeness
to their primitive character, being ultimately reducible upon
analysis to a series of displacements of a very few original
trends and impulses. These original impulses fall naturally into
two main groups:&mdash;those which bind the individual to the
family (or to one or more of its members) through a relationship
of love, esteem or dependence; and those which are based on
a relationship of hate or fear; the trends falling within each of
these groups being manifested either in a direct and positive,
or in a reactionary and negative form; the latter being assumed
as the result of a conflict between one of the trends in question
and some other trend of an opposite, or at any rate a different,
character (very often one of the family trends belonging
to the opposite group).</p>

<p>Since these groups of impulses have shown themselves to
play a part of such importance in human mind and human conduct,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
it is not unnatural that, having completed our review of
<span class="sidenote">The theoretical
treatment
of our subject
and its
difficulties</span>
their manifestations, we should feel some curiosity as to the
manner in which they have come to play this part in the
course of the past history of the human race and as to the
nature of the influence which they have exerted on this history.
Unfortunately in the present state of our knowledge it would
not seem possible to gratify this curiosity except in a very
partial, unsatisfactory and uncertain manner. The psychological
mechanisms with which we have been dealing have themselves,
for the most part, been too recently discovered to have as
yet been adequately correlated, or brought into connection,
with the relevant facts of anthropological, ethnographical or
biological science. The data from these latter sources are moreover,
in spite of much diligent research in recent years,
still in many important respects too incomplete to afford a
satisfactory basis for such correlation. As a consequence of
these conditions, it is to be feared that any attempt that we
may make to exhibit the psychical tendencies with which we
have been concerned, in their bearings upon early human
history, or to explain their origin in the light of this history
or of the general conditions of human life and mind, will result
in little more than a restatement of our psychological principles
from a slightly different point of view. Nevertheless the attempt
may be worth making. A summary of some of the main implications
of our psychological knowledge in this field may
perhaps not seem amiss&mdash;especially in view of the astonishing
and unlooked-for character of much of this knowledge&mdash;and
if we succeed in establishing a few connections between our
psychological data and the related facts of anthropology or
biology, these may perhaps serve as starting points&mdash;to be
either proved or else corrected&mdash;for subsequent enquiries
based on a more sound foundation. The reader will understand
therefore that, in so far as in the present and the two succeeding
chapters there is anything that is not&mdash;explicitly or implicitly&mdash;contained
in what we have already said, we shall
have left the region of comparative certainty afforded by the
results of observation and induction, and shall be travelling
for the most part on the unsure ground of speculation&mdash;speculation
that can be justified only on the plea of natural curiosity,
and by the hope of opening up a few vistas which may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
be more fully surveyed by better equipped workers in the
future.</p>

<p>Of the two main groups of tendencies to which we have
<span class="sidenote">The hate
tendencies to
some extent
inevitable</span>
above referred&mdash;which we may briefly call the love and hate
groups&mdash;the former opens up a number of problems in this
connection which would seem to be in some significant respects
deeper, more important and more complex than those raised
by the latter. The hate tendencies are, indeed, as regards the
cause and nature of their origin and development, in the main
not so very difficult to understand. Psychologists are pretty
well agreed as to the circumstances which give rise to anger
and fear&mdash;the emotions which chiefly underlie the attitude of
hate. Anger arises when the activities, tendencies or wishes of
the individual are interfered with or when the individual is
unwillingly forced to undergo some disagreeable or undesirable
experience, and it is directed to the object from which such
interference or such infliction of undesired experience is forthcoming.
Fear arises when harm is threatened to the individual
or to that which he possesses or holds dear, and is directed
to the threatening object<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>.</p>

<p>Now, as we have seen, the normal conditions of family
life necessarily give rise to some extent to the situations which
arouse these emotions. Through the mere exercise of ordinary
parental authority and care, and more especially through the
process of elementary moral training and education, the parent
invariably interferes in some ways with the primitive desires
and tendencies of the child, and threatens the child with
punishment in the event of his transgressing the parental
prohibitions; the conditions are therefore present for the arousal
in the child's mind of anger and fear towards the parent,
should the child be at all susceptible to these emotions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>We have seen that the hate attitude is sometimes and
<span class="sidenote">Jealousy as
a necessary
consequence
of marriage</span>
to some extent brought about indirectly as a consequence of
jealousy aroused in connection with the love attitude (jealousy
being caused by interference with the successful function of
the love impulses), sometimes more directly by a more general
hostility between parent and child. In so far as the first case
is concerned, the hate attitude is obviously dependent upon
the existence of sexual rivalry between the child and one of
the parents. Granted the existence of the love impulse of the
child towards the parent of the opposite sex, the conditions
of this rivalry are to be found whenever the two parents live
together&mdash;in fact wherever there is marriage, and more
especially wherever there is monogamy. Now marriage of some
sort would seem to exist in practically every human community&mdash;both
primitive and cultured&mdash;that has as yet been subjected to
any degree of careful study or investigation; in fact there is
every reason to regard it as an institution fundamentally
characteristic of the human race and of immemorial antiquity.
It is therefore not surprising that we find evidence of sexual
jealousy between parents and children in many early myths
and customs and in the legends and beliefs of many peoples,
both cultivated and uncivilised. There is good ground for
supposing that parent hatred based on jealousy has been
called into existence in innumerable successive generations
and has thus had ample opportunity to impress itself on the
forms, traditions and institutions of human society.</p>

<p>In those societies which have developed or maintained a
<span class="sidenote">and especially
of monogamy</span>
relatively strict monogamy we should expect that this kind of
parent hatred would be more easily and extensively developed
than in those in which the marriage tie is looser, wider or more
elastic, since in the former case the hatred bred of jealousy
would necessarily be directed on to a single individual, whereas
in the latter it might lose in intensity through diffusion over
a number of different persons. Now it is a feature of that
relatively early stage of culture which with Wundt<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> we may
perhaps call the Totemic age that the family ties are as a
rule relaxed in favour of those wider bonds that unite together
the different members of the tribe or clan. In this age we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
often find that some form of group marriage exists or shows
evident traces of having existed; in distinction to the more or
less strictly monogamous unions that are characteristic both of
those races of mankind which are at a more primitive level of
development and of those that have reached a more advanced
stage of culture. We might imagine therefore that this Totemic
<span class="sidenote">Parent-child
jealousy
perhaps less
pronounced in
the Totemic
Age</span>
age was distinguished by a lessening of the parent jealousy
which must probably have existed both in the earlier and in
the later societies of a more strictly monogamic kind. We have
seen indeed that a reconciliation between fathers and sons is
one of the motives which finds expression in the initiation
ceremonies&mdash;ceremonies that arise and flourish principally at
the Totemic stage of culture. The men's clubs&mdash;one of the
institutions most typical of this age&mdash;would again seem to
point to the existence of a tendency to do away with the
hostility between man and man by establishing a community
of interest and affection between the members of the clubs, who
are brought into more intimate contact with one another than
would be the case if they remained each more strictly within
the confines of their own families. A similar result is no doubt
to some extent achieved by the corresponding throwing together
of the women, who are freed from the more intimate dependence
on the male that is fostered in a more closely knit family
system. At the same time the relative sexual freedom that is
frequently permitted, especially before marriage, affords an
unfavourable environment for the development of jealousy; as
is shown by the absence of this passion so frequently exhibited
both within and without the marriage bond. Indeed there
would seem to be almost necessarily some degree of correspondence
between the strictness of the marriage relationship and
the development of jealousy. So long as men and women
regard themselves as possessing certain exclusive rights and
privileges over one or more members of the opposite sex, they
are bound to resent any conduct which might appear to constitute
an infringement or challenge of these rights; freedom
from jealousy can only be obtained under these circumstances
by perfect confidence that no such attempt will be made, or,
if made, will be unsuccessful&mdash;a condition of mind which
requires a more complete adaptation to the married state on
the part of all concerned than can usually be secured. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
other hand, if no such exclusive privileges as are implied in
the strict observance of the marriage bond are demanded or
expected, there is no ground or occasion for the development
of any high degree of jealousy. Monogamy, the strictest and
most exclusive form of marriage, is thus most especially liable
to bring jealousy in its train, since here all sexual tendencies and
privileges are centred round one person, who has to be guarded
at whatever cost against the advances of all other suitors<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>.</p>

<p>The Totemic age, characterised as it is by a recession in
importance of the family ties as compared with those of a wider
social unit, would appear then in one of its aspects to have
been marked by a strong tendency to get rid of jealousy,
<span class="sidenote">which differs
in this respect
both from
preceding and
succeeding
ages</span>
together with certain other of the passions which are aroused
in connection with, or centre round, the family. It differs thus
from the more strictly monogamic condition, which, according
to our most recent knowledge, would seem to exist among the
really primitive races of mankind<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>. It differs also, perhaps even
more markedly, from the conditions of the patriarchal family&mdash;that
form of family which seems on the whole to be characteristic
of the post-Totemic stage of culture<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>. At this latter stage the
family&mdash;now however often in an enlarged form comprising
several smaller family groups and several generations&mdash;once
more becomes the predominant social unit; societies based on
the tribal or clan system having apparently proved themselves
more unstable or less capable of expansion and development
than those based upon the more fundamental unit of the family.
The decline of jealousy and of the hatreds based thereon was
therefore, we may suppose, at the close of the Totemic age
replaced by a recrudescence of that more vigorous hostility
between father and son, mother and daughter, between brothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and between sisters, which is to some extent inevitable in a
closely united monogamic family&mdash;a hostility which has continued
to exist uninterruptedly until the present day.</p>

<p>Much the same is also true, no doubt, as regards those
aspects of intra-family hostilities which are not based on
jealousy. In the monogamic families of primitive man these
<span class="sidenote">Similar
differences
as regards
other aspects
of intra-family
hatred</span>
latter aspects of hostility had no doubt free scope within certain
limits. In the looser family conditions of the Totemic age it
seems probable that passions based on mutual interference of
different members of the family with each other's interests and
desires would be a good deal less developed. In the patriarchal
family of the later epoch conditions would seem however to
become favourable once again to the development of hostility
of this kind, particularly to that between father and son. The
close and permanent organisation of the family under the
patriarchal system brings it about that the interests of father
and son continue to be to some extent antagonistic long after
the son has reached maturity, whereas in the state more nearly
resembling that of nature the son would usually be free from
paternal tutelage as soon as he had attained to full growth.</p>

<p>The family life of most modern civilised nations is less
<span class="sidenote">The hate-producing
causes
are still potent
in modern
civilisation</span>
closely organised than that of the patriarchal family at its full
development; children as a rule becoming relatively or completely
free from parental jurisdiction, if not before, at least as soon
as, they have married and founded a home of their own.
Nevertheless the lessening of antagonism that is brought about
by this relaxation of the family organisation is often to some
extent counterbalanced by the increasing social and economic
dependence of children on their parents that is apt to arise in
advanced and complex societies, specially among the higher
and wealthier classes (<em>cp.</em> above p. 58). The irksomeness of
parental restrictions is apt to be increased too, as civilisation
advances, by the fact that the rules of conduct and of morals
inculcated by the parents tend to become in many respects
increasingly remote from the behaviour to which the young
child's primitive tendencies naturally impel him; so that a more
violent friction is likely to arise between the authority of the
parents and the will of the children in their early years<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>For these reasons the antagonism between parents and
children remains, as we know, strong even in present day
civilisation, though there are grounds for thinking that it may
perhaps have been stronger in those earlier stages of society
in which a more complex patriarchal system flourished.</p>

<p>As regards the negative or reactionary aspects of the hate
<span class="sidenote">Negative
aspects of the
hate attitude</span>
attitude, it is pretty clear that the influences which tend to
produce repression or inhibition of the hate are in the main
of two kinds:&mdash;(1) "moral" influences, such as the acceptance
of a code of ethics, or of a tradition, with which parent hatred
is incompatible; (2) the co-existence with the hate of a genuine
love, admiration or respect towards the parent who is hated.</p>

<p>As regards the ultimate psychological nature of the first
<span class="sidenote">"Moral"
influences</span>
of these factors, we are face to face with a problem concerning
which there is at present no very great degree of certainty or
unanimity, <em>i. e.</em> the problem of the general nature of the forces
of repression which inhibit the immoral or anti-social tendencies
of the mind. Freud<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> is inclined to lay stress upon the impulses
centering round the self (though more especially in connection
with the repression of the sexual trends); others, like McCurdy<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a>
Trotter<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> and Hart<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a>, emphasize the importance of the gregarious
tendencies in this connection. Whatever may be their ultimate
basis in the mind, there can be little doubt however that these
moral forces on the whole increase with advancing culture,
thus tending always to substitute an indirect or negative for
the more primitive direct or positive expression of the hate
attitude towards the parents.</p>

<p>As regards the second factor, the arousal of love in opposition
<span class="sidenote">Love that
conflicts with
and represses
hate</span>
to hate is evidently dependent partly (a) upon the child's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
own innate capacities for affection, tenderness and gratitude;
partly (b) upon the extent to which these capacities are
awakened and called into play by a kind and loving attitude
on the part of the parent towards the child. As regards these
factors it seems very difficult to say in the present state of our
knowledge whether there has been any considerable or lasting
change during the later period of human development. The
extent to which tender feelings have been aroused between
parents and children of the same sex (for it is of course with
the relations between these that we are chiefly concerned here)
has naturally varied from age to age and from one family
system to another; the intensity and frequency of these feelings
being as a rule in inverse proportion to the intensity of the hate
attitude. Thus it is that those times and places which have produced
the minimum of hatred between parents and children have also
probably on the whole tended to bring about the greatest degree
of repression of such hatred as did still exist&mdash;the repression
being due to the influence of love tendencies which were opposed
to those of hate. Nevertheless it is not easy to bring forward
any evidence to show a general tendency towards increase of
the tender feelings with which we are here concerned. Savage
parents in many cases appear to exhibit a very considerable
degree of affection towards their children, while the children are
in their turn often not backward in their manifestations of love
and respect. Parents in civilised communities, on the other
hand, have often shown themselves (under a veneer of kindness
or consideration) singularly brutal and selfish in the treatment
of their children; the latter not infrequently manifesting a
corresponding lack of genuine affection for their parents. Under
these circumstances it would seem that we are perhaps justified
in attributing the undoubted increase in the repression of the
hate attitude to the more efficient operation of the "moral"
factors, rather than to any growth of tenderness between parent
and child which might have served more effectually to counter-act
the hostile tendencies.</p>

ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT<br />
OF THE FAMILY TENDENCIES&mdash;LOVE ASPECTS</h2>


<p>The problems connected with the origin, development and
<span class="sidenote">The love
attitude</span>
influence upon human history of the love attitude in relation
to the family are, as we have said, in some respects both more
important and more difficult than those connected with the
hate attitude&mdash;more important because, as we have seen
throughout, the hate attitude is to a considerable extent merely
a consequence of, or at any rate dependent on, the love
attitude; more difficult, because the psychic tendencies which
enter into the love attitude are in general more unconscious
in character, further removed from our everyday standard
of conscious thought and feeling and, on the whole, subject
also to more violent and more permanent conflicts and repressions.</p>

<p>We have seen that, in its positive form, this love attitude
<span class="sidenote">The positive
and negative
aspects that
have to be
considered</span>
manifests itself in an incestuous affection&mdash;in the first place,
perhaps always of the child for its mother; in what is perhaps
a slightly more developed, but certainly a more easily recognisable
form, of the child for its parent of the opposite sex;
in a still more developed form, of brothers for sisters, or of
more remote relatives for one another. In its negative form
this attitude is manifested as a violent antipathy to any such
incestuous attachment, at any rate in so far as this attachment
assumes the sexual form or anything resembling such a form.
We have here to consider, first, what can be the influences
which bring about this incestuous attachment in the human
mind&mdash;an attachment of such durability that, as we have seen,
it determines to a large extent the nature and course of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
whole of the subsequent love life of the individual, as well as
of many of the activities which lie apparently far removed
from the sphere of love or sex; secondly, given the existence
of this attachment, what are the further influences which have
brought about its repression&mdash;a repression that corresponds
in strength and influence to the importance of the positive
impulse to which it is opposed.</p>

<p>Let us consider first the positive side of the love attitude.
<span class="sidenote">Influences
determining
the positive
aspects</span>
The influences which, we may suggest, play an important part
in bringing about a strong tendency to the formation of
incestuous affections in the human mind may be most conveniently
grouped under a number of separate heads.</p>

<p>(1) First in time and perhaps also in importance would
<span class="sidenote">The long
duration of
human
childhood</span>
seem to be a group of factors connected with the long period
of infancy, childhood and youth, which characterises, to a
greater or a less extent, all branches of the human race. During
this long period, the child is, as we have more than once
emphasised, wholly or partially dependent on its parents for
the satisfaction of its needs. Now it is a fundamental tendency
of the mind to experience pleasure in connection with, and
generally to appreciate, those objects which administer to, or
are associated with, the basic needs and requirements of the
organism; <em>i. e.</em> the mind tends naturally to react towards these
objects in a manner which, at a higher level of development,
we should designate as love<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>. It is not altogether surprising
then that, the parents being for many years associated with
the fulfilment of the great majority of conscious needs, the
nascent love of the child should be directed to them in a
greater measure than to any other object.</p>

<p>(2) It is a pretty generally recognised fact that&mdash;in virtue
<span class="sidenote">Primitive sympathy
reacting
on the
expressions of
instinctive
parental
feeling</span>
of a process which McDougall<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> has conveniently designated
primitive sympathy&mdash;among the stimuli which are most effective
in producing any given feeling or emotion are the manifestations
of that feeling or emotion in some other person or persons.
Now it is generally admitted by psychologists that the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of children tends to evoke an instinctive affection and
tenderness on the part of the parents; the biological justification,
and indeed necessity, for such an instinct, as well as
for the fact of its existence being indeed sufficiently manifest&mdash;especially
no doubt in women but to a considerable extent in
men also. In virtue of this instinctive tenderness parents
naturally give expression to their affection in the presence of
the children, whereupon the latter, reacting through primitive
sympathy, tend to experience affection in their turn and to
direct it upon the nearest and most appropriate object&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> the
parent whose manifestations of tenderness have aroused the
emotion. This sequence of events being frequently repeated, the
child's affections come in time to be firmly attached to the parent,
reciprocating the affection he receives from this direction.</p>

<p>(3) Again, it is evident that, especially in primitive
<span class="sidenote">Love and
respect as
elements of
imitation and
suggestibility</span>
communities, the child is dependent on its parent, not only for
the fulfilment of its elementary needs and desires, but also for
the opportunity of learning how to fulfil these needs and
desires in its own person. This process of learning implies&mdash;especially
perhaps in immature minds&mdash;a tendency to imitate
the teacher and to be suggestible towards him. Now suggestibility,
as we have already seen, probably depends to a
considerable extent upon love; it certainly depends largely upon
an attitude of respect or admiration on the part of the one
who is suggestible. Much the same is true of imitation; we
notoriously tend to imitate those whom we love, whom we
admire, and to whom we look up with confidence and veneration.
This being the case, the adoption of an attitude of love and respect
towards his parents, would be of considerable advantage to the
child, as enabling him to acquire more readily those capacities,
habits and ideas which he most naturally learns from his parents
(and later on from those on to whom the parent-regarding
feelings are displaced) through imitation and suggestion. In
view of the comparatively unformed and plastic condition of
many of the instinctive tendencies in human infants, the ability
to learn easily and quickly from their elders is of great
importance to children in their early years. We have here
then very possibly a factor which contributes to the survival-value
of a strong parent attachment, though it may not actually
call any such attachment into being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) Modern psychology is showing more and more that
the growth of man's principal instinctive tendencies is continuous
from early youth upward to maturity, there being few or no
<span class="sidenote">Early arousal
of sex
tendencies in
the family is
necessary for
cultural
displacements</span>
sudden changes, transitions or fresh departures as development
proceeds. The work of Freud and his followers has, above all,
clearly shown that the sexual tendencies are not narrowly
confined to processes intimately connected with the reproduction
of the species, but pervade the whole life of the individual,
manifesting themselves in a great variety of ways, many of
which are very far removed from the reproductive sphere but
are of the greatest importance in the increase and maintenance
of culture. More especially it has been shown (in a way which
we have to some extent already studied) that these tendencies
undergo a continuous process of development from childhood
upwards, and that on their growth and history depends to a
considerable extent the character and social value of the
individual.</p>

<p>Such being the nature and conditions of development of
this important aspect of the mind, it is evident that something
akin to the later affections characteristic of maturity should be
found even in the earliest attachments of the child. It is only
on the mistaken assumption that the sexual impulse emerges,
as it were, fully grown at the time of puberty, that the
existence of sexual elements in the loves of an earlier age
appears surprising. In reality it is necessary, if the sexual
tendencies are to play their important role in the displacements
involved in the civilised adult life, that they should ripen
early, even though they may not be required for purposes of
reproduction for many years to come; and if they are to ripen
early, it is only natural that they should be called into play
in the child's relations to his parents, who are as a rule by
far the most prominent persons of his environment during the
first years of his existence. It would seem probable, the human
mind being constituted as it is, that unless the large source of
energy which is contained in, and habitually manifested through,
the sexual tendencies (in the wide sense assigned to them by
Freud) were made available in infancy or early childhood, the
child would have too little motive at its disposal to make the
vast efforts necessary to enable it to pass from the helplessness
and ignorance of infancy to the relatively enormous skill and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
knowledge of adult life, and to acquire the manifold and
complex characteristics of an age-long culture. The early
awakening of the sexual tendencies in connection with the life
of the family thus reveals itself as a natural&mdash;and indeed
perhaps to some extent an inevitable&mdash;condition of any high
degree of human civilisation or cultural achievement.</p>

<p>(5) Another factor of great importance in mental and
<span class="sidenote">Necessity for
the early
transition from
Autoerotism
to object-love</span>
moral development, as regards which the early direction of
love on to the parents plays an important part, is one to
which we have already often had occasion to refer&mdash;the
development of object love as distinct from the more primitive
levels of sexuality manifested in Autoerotism and Narcissism.
The full social and ethical implications of this change are not
yet completely understood&mdash;the whole subject of the Narcissistic
trends and their manifestations, normal and abnormal, having
only recently been studied by the psycho-analytic method&mdash;but
it is abundantly clear that these are of very considerable
significance. Failure to carry out the change successfully would
seem to bring with it almost inevitably certain grave defects
of character, involving an exaggerated egoism and a correspondingly
deficient altruism; defects which must seriously
detract from the social value of the individual, and which when
present in large numbers of the population, must imperil the
success or even the existence of the social organism.
It is essential therefore that the stage of object-love
should become firmly established in at least a majority of
individuals if society is to prosper, and, as we have seen, the
transition from Autoerotism to object-love is under normal
human conditions brought about in connection with the child's
relations to its parents. How indeed could this transition be
more easily and surely achieved than through this relationship&mdash;at
once the earliest, the most necessary and, in many ways,
the most intimate which the individual ever knows? Through
the affection which the child feels towards those who supply
its elementary needs, it learns the meaning of attachment to
an object outside itself&mdash;an attachment which, in its further
development, leads to the tendency to seek the goal of effort
and desire in the outer world rather than in intimate
connection with the self, the tendency upon which all altruism
is ultimately based. Just as the early awakening of the sexual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
impulses ensures that these impulses shall have time and
opportunity to devote the great motive power at their disposal
to the work involved in mental growth and education, so the
early arousal of object-love in connection with the parents
ensures that these impulses shall take that direction which
alone will enable the child to become a useful and a pleasant
member of society.</p>

<p>(6) If the incestuous direction of affection thus assists the
<span class="sidenote">The Narcissistic
love
elements are
also satisfied
by incestuous
affection</span>
development of object-love, we must not forget that at the
same time it is calculated to give a considerable degree of
satisfaction to the Narcissistic elements of love. In their most
characteristic and pronounced form, these Narcissistic elements
will usually manifest themselves in a homosexual direction and
therefore not in the typical form of incestuous heterosexual
affection with which we are here chiefly concerned. There can
be little doubt however that, in a less violent and overwhelming
form and as a factor in a total complex situation, the
Narcissistic elements do enter very frequently into normal love
between members of the opposite sexes. The similarities&mdash;physical,
mental and circumstantial&mdash;that usually exist between
those who are of common descent bring it about that a partial
identification of the self with the loved object is often easier
in the case of a blood relative than with any other person.
Hence the influence of this factor will frequently add itself to
the other forces which tend to produce an incestuous direction
of affection.</p>

<p>The partial identification upon which the operation of this
Narcissistic factor in object-love depends, may of course take
place at many different psychic levels, from one at which the
perception of the resemblance between the loved object and
the self may to some extent enter into consciousness, to one
at which the identification seems to rest upon some mysterious
deep-seated and archaic bond of union, depending possibly
upon organic factors or upon the experiences of pre-natal life&mdash;such
a bond for instance as that which arises perhaps as a
result of the close vital connection between mother and child
during the period of gestation and lactation<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>In this way the love of a child to those who are related
<span class="sidenote">Thus two
opposing
tendencies in
love find
simultaneous
gratification</span>
to it by ties of blood&mdash;and particularly to the parents&mdash;is such
as to afford a convenient compromise between two sets of
conflicting impulses&mdash;the impulses that tend to the development
of object-love and those more primitive ones that manifest
themselves most clearly at the autoerotic and Narcissistic levels.
Such a compromise formation is, as we know, peculiarly
characteristic of the process of displacement. It is a general
law of mental progress in conation that in the new direction
of activity that results from a conflict of impulses, there are
to be found certain elements that are connected with the
satisfaction of both conflicting aims. As a ready means of
providing such common elements, the love of parents and of
other relatives may therefore in very many cases be supported
by the energy derived both from the Narcissistic and the
object-seeking components of affection. Hence another potent
reason for the widespread occurrence of this form of love.</p>

<p>(7) Another set of factors working towards the production
<span class="sidenote">The dependence
aspects
may also indirectly
foster
incestuous
tendencies</span>
and maintenance of the tendencies to incest are those connected
with the dependence of the youthful <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'individiual'">individual</ins> on the family,
with all that this implies. We have already, in Chapters IV
and V studied the manner in which the inertia of habit, the
difficulties involved in the growth of individuality, the efforts
required for self-governance, self-maintenance and independence
and the tendency to regress to an earlier stage of development
in the face of obstacles, all combine to produce the retention
of, or the return to, a relatively infantile attitude towards the
family. We were there chiefly concerned with the aspects of
self-preservation and self-expression rather than with the aspects
of love or reproduction, but it is evident that the infantile and
childish stages of both aspects must be associated with one
another, so that a fixation at an early stage of development
with regard to one aspect will be likely to bring with it a
corresponding fixation as regards the other. Thus, for instance,
an undue reluctance to abandon the conception of the mother
as the protector and provider of childhood may easily entail a
similar failure of growth on the erotic side. In general it would
appear that the inertia of the human mind, which so often
involves a failure to emancipate the self from the trammels of
the early family life, will tend inevitably to produce a corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
want of adjustment in the love life. This factor of
itself would not suffice to bring about the tendency to incest,
but, given the existence of this tendency, it might constitute an
influence of very considerable power in maintaining the tendency
in question, both in the individual and in the race, and might
even be a means of producing a reversion to this tendency in
cases where it seemed to have been superseded or outgrown.</p>

<p>(8) The sentiment of parent love having been called into
existence by the aid of the factors we have already enumerated&mdash;directly
in the case of 1 and 2, more indirectly in the case of
4, 5 and 6 and still more indirectly perhaps in the case of
3 and 7&mdash;all conditions are particularly favourable for its
<span class="sidenote">The sentiment
of parent-love
is powerful in
virtue of its
early formation</span>
continuance and growth. In the first place, it is almost certainly
one of the earliest important sentiments to be formed, the only
other one which can compare with it in this respect being the
self-regarding sentiment. It thus enjoys as compared with most
others sentiments all the advantage afforded by priority. What
the exact nature of any such advantage may be, it would be
hazardous to suggest in detail: we know however that it is a
general characteristic of the function and development of mind
that dispositions which are formed early in the life of the
individual enjoy a greater stability and permanence than those
subsequently acquired. Even where, as so often happens, the
function of the earlier dispositions is modified or obscured by
the results of later experience, the phenomena of "regression"
to earlier levels, as manifested in pathology, show clearly
enough that the earlier dispositions remain intact throughout
life and in many cases seem to be (in themselves and apart
from the influence of extraneous factors) paths that offer less
resistance to the passage of emotional energy than do those
formed at a later period. It may well be then that its priority
of formation gives to the sentiment of parent-love a more
stable and deep-rooted foundation than that enjoyed by any
sentiment subsequently formed.</p>

<p>Further, psycho-analytic study appears to indicate very
strongly that it is in the nature of the mind for <em>all</em> the earliest
channels of conative energy not only to remain capable of
functioning in later life, but actually to continue to function,
though often in such a degree or in such a way as to have but
little if any <em>direct</em> influence on consciousness or action. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
it would appear that when a sublimation is formed and
emotional energy is directed into a fresh channel, not all the
energy passing through the original channel is deflected; some,
on the contrary, continues to pass along the original channel.
At each fresh sublimation this process is repeated, so that,
to use a simile of Freud's, we may compare the development
of the Libido to the history of a wandering tribe, which at
each fresh migration leaves some of its members behind in the
home it is just leaving (the larger the proportion of the population
that is left behind&mdash;<em>i. e.</em> the greater the fixations&mdash;the greater
being of course the tendency to regress along the former line
of advance when an obstacle is encountered). In such a system
of function and development, it is clear that the oldest channels
are necessarily, in a sense, the most stable and permanent, the
least easy to modify or to destroy.</p>

<p>In this respect then the channels comprising the sentiment
of parent-love are comparable to all other early channels of
the Libido. Just as the autoerotic trends connected with the
oral, anal and urethral regions of the body and the primitive
tendencies to sadism, masochism and exhibitionism have been
shown to underlie many of the activities of adult life, so (on
a higher and more complex level of development) parent-love
has been revealed as the foundation upon which rests the
greater part of the affection of childhood, adolescence and
maturity. From this point of view it would appear that
parent-love, in its persistence and influence on later life, exhibits
characteristics which are, in greater or less degree, common to
all the earliest manifestations of the Libido.</p>

<p>In one important respect however the history of parent
<span class="sidenote">Furthermore,
numerous
influences
favour its
persistence</span>
love differs from the history of many other of these early
manifestations. Parent-love not only comes into being at a very
early age, but, as regards many of its attributes, it normally
persists with but little alteration throughout the whole of the
impressionable period from infancy to adolescence. The sensual
elements of this love are, it is true, for the most part repressed
soon after they appear, but the elements of tenderness and
veneration usually remain and build up a sentiment which
operates vigorously and continuously for many years, whereas
the other sentiments formed during this period (with the
exception again of the self-regarding sentiment) are apt to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of a far more temporary and evanescent character. It is true,
as we have seen, that as development proceeds the affection
felt towards the parents is to some extent displaced on to
other persons, but nevertheless, in the normal course of events,
a large portion of this affection remains throughout early life
fixated on its original object. Moreover as regards this fixation
of affection on the parents (provided only no sensual element
be too apparent), the individual meets as a rule with every
encouragement and sign of approval from those about him, not
with the disapprobation or ridicule which he often encounters
when his affections are directed elsewhere. The sentiment of
parent love has therefore the support of moral sanction in a
way enjoyed by few, if any, other sentiments of love that may
be formed in early life.</p>

<p>We see therefore that both as regards priority of formation
and as regards duration, vigour and continuity of function
throughout the all important period of development, parent
love normally occupies an almost unique place among the
sentiments&mdash;a place which renders to some extent intelligible
the importance of the role it plays in human life.</p>

<p>(9) Finally, the tendency to incestuous direction of affection,
<span class="sidenote">The tendency
to incest thus
brought about
is strengthened
by practice
and tradition</span>
having once been brought into existence, has no doubt been
strengthened and consolidated by the actual practice of incest
that has pretty certainly occurred on a wide scale among certain
races and at certain levels of development<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the actual observation of incestuous practices
<span class="sidenote">The
occurrence of
incest may also
be inferred
from certain
practices and
institutions</span>
at the present day, the previous occurrence of incest on a wide
scale may (as we have already to some extent indicated in
earlier chapters) frequently be inferred with some degree of
certainty from the nature of practices, customs, observances
and institutions which seem to be remnants or vestiges of a
one-time general prevalence of incest. We have already referred
to the practice of brother-sister marriage among certain lines
of monarchs (p. 91), to the customs of the levirate and sororate
(p. 93) and of group marriage (p. 90), the <em>droit de seigneur</em>
(p. 143) and the licence frequently permitted at certain festivals
such as initiation (p. 89).</p>

<p>Evidence for the previous existence of incest is also forthcoming
from the measures and prohibitions erected to prevent
it. The "avoidances" practised by a large number of savage
peoples are very numerous and have reference to all the
principal relationships, both those of blood and those acquired
by marriage. These "avoidances" are unhesitatingly regarded by
most authorities as customs adopted as a precaution against
incest.</p>

<p>The most striking institution of this kind is however undoubtedly
<span class="sidenote">Especially
from Exogamy</span>
that of Exogamy. There is as yet no complete consensus
of opinion as to the causes that have led to the origin
and development of exogamy, but the majority of the eminent
investigators who have devoted themselves to the subject agree
that the avoidance of incest is the principal factor that has led
to the creation of the system. The various stages of exogamic
development, as seen in Australia, appear to constitute so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
fresh encroachments upon the liberty of incest<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>, the later and
more complex four class system prohibiting certain unions
between relatives that the earlier and simpler two class system
has permitted, while the eight class system in turn prevents
those that are not excluded under the four class system,
though the actual relationships prohibited differ somewhat
according to whether descent is traced in the male or
female line.</p>

<p>There is a considerable amount of evidence to show that
<span class="sidenote">Exogamy was
probably
preceded by
Endogamy</span>
exogamy, where now in force, was preceded by a period in
which the unions prohibited under its rule were freely indulged
in, though the marriage tie was at the same time broader and
less binding. Thus of the Central Australians Spencer and
Gillen<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> say that tradition "seems to point back to a time when
a man always married a woman of his own totem. The
reference to men and woman of one totem always living
together in groups would appear to be too frequent to admit
of any other satisfactory explanation. We never meet in
tradition with an instance of a man living with a woman who
was not of his own totem." The same conclusion as to the
former universal prevalence of endogamy emerges from a
study of the actually observed condition of the Australian
natives, the rude and uncultivated tribes of the interior being
still to some extent endogamic, while there is a gradual
increase in the frequency and strictness of exogamy, as we
proceed from these to the more advanced communities of the
north<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>. Among the Kacharis of Assam we have an example of
what is probably the still more primitive process of a
<em>compulsory</em> endogamy giving place to freedom to marry outside
the totem group, endogamy being here thus not only permitted
but enjoined<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>. Other indications of the co-existence of endogamy
with a totemic system are found in Madagascar<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and in
N.W. America<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a>.</p>

<p>Frazer supposes that exogamy in its beginning arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
originally as a restriction upon complete promiscuity, though
he admits that such promiscuity need not have been characteristic
of absolutely primitive man<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>. As a matter of fact the
most primitive races that we know seem to be usually
<span class="sidenote">Really
primitive races
mostly monogamous
and
endogamous</span>
<em>monogamous</em> and <em>endogamous</em>. This is for instance to a greater
or less extent the case with the Veddahs<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>, the Andamanese<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>,
the lowest forest tribes of Brazil<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>, the inhabitants of the
interior of Borneo<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>, the Semangs and Senoi of the Malay
Peninsula<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>, and the Negritos of the Philippines<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> and Central
Africa<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>.</p>

<p>In these primitive peoples and in those who, as we must
<span class="sidenote">The family is
therefore their
principal
social unit</span>
suppose, formerly resembled them, the family would appear to
be a more closely knit and socially a more important unit than
in the later age of totemism and exogamy; there being in this
respect a resemblance between the primitive condition and that
of the post-totemic patriarchal period. There is reason to
believe however that in the case of really primitive man (in
distinction from the later patriarchal period) the family is often
the only permanent and stable unit; such approximation to
tribal organisation as exists being mostly of a temporary or
<span class="sidenote">Incest a natural
consequence
of such
conditions</span>
fluctuating character. With such peoples the low state of culture
will often necessitate a relatively scattered population, and in
these circumstances endogamy and incest may be a natural&mdash;indeed
possibly sometimes an inevitable&mdash;consequence; for where
families live in relative isolation for long periods together,
opportunities for marriage outside the family may be few, and
abstention from sexual activities during these periods would
imply a greater power of continence than would seem as a
rule to be possessed by primitive peoples. Incest would
naturally follow too under these conditions from the early
ripening of the sexual instinct which is generally found in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
primitive man<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>. The very early cohabitation of the sexes which
results therefrom would, in relatively isolated families, almost
necessarily occur in an incestuous form.</p>

<p>If these influences have made incest a common practice
<span class="sidenote">How do past
incestuous
practices produce
present
tendencies to
incest?</span>
at one period of man's history, in what ways has this practice
contributed to the tendency to incest found at a later date and
at the present day? In view of the widespread (we are probably
justified in saying universal) occurrence of this tendency, of the
relative uniformity of its ultimate nature in spite of manifold
differences of culture, training, and environment, of the great
strength which it possesses even after ages of repression, there
is not unnaturally a temptation to regard it as an innate factor
in man's mental constitution, <em>i. e.</em>, to assert that there is in
man an hereditary tendency to direct his love and sexual
<span class="sidenote">The influence
of heredity and
of tradition</span>
inclination to those who are of his own blood or at any rate
to those with whom he has been brought up and has been
familiar since his infancy<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>. Possibly in the long ages in which
man or his pre-human ancestors lived in relatively isolated
families, this tendency was of advantage in the struggle for
existence, in so much as it may have contributed both to more
rapid multiplication and to the greater consolidation, and
therefore greater safety and stability, of the family, as the
most important social unit. The tendency to incest may thus
be due ultimately to the action of natural selection; the long
period during which incest was regularly practised may have
established and ingrained it as a normal feature of the
race and its persistence to-day may be due to the continuance
of the hereditary disposition thus formed and thus
consolidated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the direct influence of this hereditary factor
however, a long period during which incest was habitual
may have affected the tendency to incest at a later time through
custom, law and tradition. These change but slowly in a
primitive society, and, through their inertia, would tend to
reinforce or maintain the hereditary factor, even when, owing
to the action of other causes, incest may have been abandoned
in the main in favour of exogamy. These influences may have
kept alive the remembrance of, and desire for, incest, which
would otherwise possibly have succumbed to the forces working
to bring about its suppression.</p>

Incest
Repression</span>
being and maintained by some such causes, or combination of
causes, as we have considered in the last chapter, what are the
influences that have brought about the inhibition and repression
of this tendency&mdash;influences which, as we have already
remarked, must be strong in proportion to the strength of the
tendency itself? We find here, as was not the case with
our discussion of the positive aspects of the tendency, that
certain explanations have already been advanced, though these
are for the most part obviously unsatisfactory, or at best
incomplete.</p>

<p>(1) The reasons which are given by primitive peoples for
their obedience to the rule of exogamy are various; sometimes
<span class="sidenote">Explanations
of primitive
peoples</span>
it is considered that harm would come to the pair who are
guilty of the forbidden union, this perhaps being usually of
the nature of some disease, or else very frequently, impotence
or barrenness; sometimes it is the offspring of the guilty pair
who will incur the penalty; quite often, however, the evil
results of such a union are supposed to affect the whole
community to which they belong and consist not uncommonly
in general infertility of women, animals and plants. These
reasons, though they no doubt exercise a powerful influence
among those who hold them, are for the most part too
obviously of the nature of superstitions, inventions or rationalisations
to be taken at their face value; though the study of
them on psycho-analytic principles would no doubt bring
interesting and suggestive results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly much more satisfactory, if regarded as attempts
at affording complete and ultimate explanations, are some of
hypotheses that have been put forward by modern students
of exogamy.</p>

<p>(2) Thus, Durkheim<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> suggests that exogamy arose as a
<span class="sidenote">Durkheim's
Theory of the
sanctity of
blood</span>
result of the religious respect for blood, particularly menstruous
blood; the divine totemic being is supposed to be resident in
blood, hence blood is sacred, especially to those of the totem
clan, and no man of this clan may trespass on the very spot
where the sacred blood periodically manifests itself. Even if
this theory should afford a satisfactory proximate explanation
of exogamy, it is obviously very far from revealing the true
ultimate biological and psychological factors that have led to
the practice. Even apart from this, however, it gives rise to
certain difficulties and objections (more especially connected
with the lack of the close correspondence between exogamous
classes and totemic clans which we should expect upon this
theory) and has almost certainly at best but a very limited
field of application<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>.</p>

<p>(3) Westermarck<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> would explain exogamy and the avoidance
<span class="sidenote">Westermarck's
theory
of an innate
aversion to
incest</span>
of incest generally as due to the fact that there is an innate
aversion to sexual intercourse between persons living together
from early youth, and that, as such persons are in most cases
related by blood, this feeling would naturally display itself in
custom and law as a horror of intercourse between near kin<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the general existence of this horror there can be no
doubt, and to assign to it an important part in framing human
opinions and institutions with regard to incest is perfectly
justifiable so long as we do not lose sight of the fact that this
horror is only one side of the total human attitude towards
the matter and that alongside of the horror there exists an
attraction towards incest which corresponds in intensity to that of
the horror itself<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>. An explanation in terms of this incest horror is
not, however, that which we are seeking; it is, on the contrary,
the very existence of this horror for which we are trying to
account. We have to ask, what are the conditions in human
life and mind that have brought about the widespread aversion
<span class="sidenote">resulting from
the injurious
effects of
inbreeding</span>
to incest that is so generally manifested. According to Westermarck,
these conditions are to be found in the process of
natural selection; marriages between near kin are, he maintains,
on the whole injurious to the species and, therefore, through
survival of the fittest, the existing races of men show a marked
aversion to such marriages.</p>

<p>In estimating the correctness of this theory, it is well to
<span class="sidenote">These effects
by no means
certain</span>
remember that the supposed ill effects of inbreeding in men
and animals are by no means as yet universally admitted by
those who have studied the subject, and that, even so far as
their existence is admitted, they are not yet fully understood
or accurately measured. It is indeed often a matter of
considerable difficulty to discover any ill effects that may be
due to this cause, especially in the case of slow breeding
animals, such as Man, and the conclusions that have been
arrived at with regard to the human race have to a great
extent been derived by analogy from observations made upon
lower animals. It would seem to be fairly generally agreed
that such ill effects as may exist arise for the most part from
the reinforcement or accentuation of hereditary weaknesses and
defects that is liable to occur in inbreeding and that members
of a perfectly healthy family might continue to mate with one
another for several (perhaps for many) generations without
evil consequences, though possibly a loss of vigour, strength or
fertility might ultimately occur. In the case of the Ptolemies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
Egypt and the Incas of Peru inbreeding of this kind has (as
we have already observed in another connection) actually been
practised and does not seem to have produced any conspicuously
bad results. There is some evidence, too, that seems to point
to the fact that the supposed ill effects of inbreeding are
due to the results of continuously similar environment and
conditions of life rather than to the physiological resemblance
of the parents, or at any rate that any evil effects of the latter
cause may be counterbalanced by a change of abode or of
the mode of living<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>.</p>

<p>East and Jones in their recent valuable survey of our
present knowledge on the subject<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> conclude quite definitely
that inbreeding is not in itself productive of ill effects, the
results of inbreeding in any particular case depending entirely
upon the hereditary qualities transmitted; so that, although in
bad stock the intensification of undesirable qualities through
inbreeding might soon bring about deterioration, in good stock
inbreeding is the surest method of making the desirable
qualities a stable and permanent characteristic of the race.
Nevertheless there are, in the opinion of these writers, certain
advantages of a general nature to be derived from outbreeding
connected principally: (1) with the occurrence of heterosis
or hybrid vigour as a result of outbreeding, (2) with the fact
that outbreeding leads to greater variability between individuals
than does inbreeding, thus giving greater scope for the action
of selective agencies and therefore endowing the race with
greater power of adaptation to a changing environment&mdash;a
factor which is probably of very considerable importance and
which indeed seems to have been overlooked in a number of
previous discussions of the subject, especially by nonbiological
writers.</p>

<p>It thus appears that stress should be laid upon the
advantages of outbreeding rather than upon the supposed ill
effects of inbreeding. Nevertheless we must admit that there
exist biological factors of such a kind as to be capable of
influencing the psychological attitude towards incest in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
that Westermarck's theory requires. But although the theory
that incest prohibition is due to natural selection working on
the <em>relative</em> disadvantages of inbreeding may be correct so far
as it goes, this does not absolve us from the duty of looking
elsewhere for other factors which may have worked in the
same direction. For it appears very doubtful whether the
factors we have just been considering can be regarded as an
adequate explanation of incest prohibition as we know it. If it
is the advantages of outbreeding rather than the disadvantages
<span class="sidenote">and can
scarcely account
for the
intensity of
the incest
prohibition</span>
of inbreeding that are potent; if the evil effects of
inbreeding are so relatively slight as to leave room for doubt
as to their nature and even the fact of their existence; if they
are of such kind as to leave healthy stocks but little if at all
affected and to become serious only after long continuance
without admixture of fresh blood from outside (a state of affairs
that can but rarely have occurred); and if they are liable to
be counteracted by a change of locality or of life's conditions
(which must sometimes have occurred, especially among
nomadic peoples): then it is not easy to understand how such
a widespread and powerful human characteristic as the aversion
to incest can have arisen <em>solely</em> as the result of natural selection,
working through the bad effects of incest or the superior
advantages of outbreeding. The largeness of the result would
be manifestly out of proportion to the cause, and it would seem
that although we may allow some considerable influence to this
factor, we have to admit that it must be supplemented by
some other cause or causes of appreciable magnitude<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>(4) According to one type of explanation (<em>e. g.</em> that
<span class="sidenote">Influence of
non-sexual
factors</span>
held by Wundt<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>) the horror of incest is not the cause of
exogamy, but the consequence of it&mdash;the origin of exogamy
itself being due to some other influences only indirectly
connected with the sex life. Of such theories of the origin of
exogamy a number have been put forward by eminent
authorities.</p>

<p>Thus McLennan<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>, the discoverer of both Totemism and
Exogamy, held the view that exogamy was a consequence of
the wide prevalence of marriage by capture; this latter being
itself a result of the preponderance of the male sex over the
female in primitive communities and of the general condition
of hostility existing between neighbouring tribes. Herbert
Spencer<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> similarly thought that exogamy arose from marriage
by capture, men belonging to successful tribes nearly always
acquiring their brides in this way, so that it eventually became
a disgrace to marry within the tribe. Lord Avebury<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>, believing
that group marriage or promiscuity was the rule in primitive
society, suggests that women taken in war belonged to their
individual captor, marriage in a narrow sense being thus
exogamous from the start. Kohler<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> believes on the contrary,
that exogamy arose as a means of bringing about inter-tribal
friendships or alliances. Andrew Lang<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> has suggested that
exogamy is due to the fact that the younger brothers of a
family were frequently driven out by the stronger and older
ones in order to ward off any want that might arise from the
living together of a large number of brothers and sisters&mdash;the
younger brothers being then obliged to marry outside the
family group.</p>

<p>Now all these factors&mdash;and others too perhaps&mdash;may very
<span class="sidenote">Such factors
cannot fully
explain
exogamy</span>
well have had their influence in bringing about the practice of
exogamy: in particular, it would seem that the difficulty of
supporting a large family living together under really primitive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
conditions would be very likely to have had the effect of
driving the younger members of the family away from the
immediate circle of their parents. Nevertheless there appears
to be a pretty general agreement that none of these theories
affords a complete and sufficient account of the origin of
exogamy. The conditions postulated by McLennan's theory
(shortage of women and frequent wars between neighbouring
groups) are by no means universally found among primitive
peoples, and even if there exists the required preponderance
of men over women, it is by no means obvious why the men
should refuse to avail themselves of such fellow-tribeswomen
as they could find. On Spencer's view, it is difficult or
impossible to account for the existence of exogamy among all
the tribes of a given area, since in constant warfare there
must be some which are vanquished, and among these endogamy
rather than exogamy should be the rule. Lord Avebury's
theory rests on the assumption that communal marriage was
the original condition of mankind&mdash;an assumption that is now
abandoned by many of the best authorities. Kohler's view can
scarcely explain how the objection to sexual unions within the
tribe should have come to apply not only to marriage but
(equally strongly) to less regular or purely temporary
connections. Andrew Lang's theory similarly fails to explain
why the rule of exogamy is made to apply to the elder
members of the family with the same force as to the younger<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, even supposing that the existence of such an
institution as exogamy could be in itself satisfactorily accounted
for on some such grounds as those advanced by theories of
this kind, it is at once evident that we have here no adequate
explanation of the strictness with which the system is enforced,
<span class="sidenote">The psychological
nature
of the incest
prohibition
shows the
insufficiency
of these
influences</span>
the severe penalties that are exacted for infringement of its
rules (which is very often punishable by death), the intense
nature of the incest horror generally, and the fact that this
horror persists even where, as in civilised countries, there is
no organised system of exogamy in the technical sense. The
psychological researches of Freud and his followers would seem
to have shown conclusively that this intense aversion to incest
(like all repugnances and taboos of a similar kind) is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
negative expression of a correspondingly intense desire for
the forbidden thing, and therefore no explanation which
neglects to take into consideration this desire can be regarded
as even approximately satisfactory. If the aversion to incest
had arisen merely as a consequence of the age-long practice
of exogamy&mdash;which itself is due to other causes&mdash;there would
be no reason why this aversion should be intimately connected
with the positive tendency to incest or of sufficient strength
to overcome this tendency, with the powerfulness of which
we are now well acquainted. In view of the existence of this
strong tendency to incest (which was not appreciated before
the work of Freud), it seems no longer possible to maintain,
either that exogamy can have arisen independently of the counter-impulse
to repress this tendency, or that this counter-impulse,
which finds its psychic expression in that incest horror so
generally observable both in primitive and cultured man, can
be satisfactorily explained as the result of any institution or
custom itself unconnected with the tendency to incest.</p>

<p>(5) Turning to factors that have in general received less
<span class="sidenote">The biological
absurdity
of parent-child
incest</span>
explicit recognition at the hands of the authorities who have
written on the subject, we may note first that as regards the
most fundamental type of incest as revealed by psycho-analytic
study&mdash;that of parent and child&mdash;there is involved a sort of
biological absurdity, which may well have been to some extent
instrumental, through the agency of natural selection, of bringing
about that inhibition of the incestuous tendencies for which we
have to account. Parents and children necessarily differ considerably
in age, though less so in most primitive communities
than in the civilised societies of to-day, where marriage is so
often postponed till relatively late in life. Even among primitive
peoples however the difference is very appreciable, especially
in view of the fact (which must be borne in mind in this
connection) that with such peoples, owing to the harder
conditions of existence, life is often shorter than in civilised
communities, while the enfeeblement that accompanies advancing
age comes on proportionately sooner. If men were to follow
blindly the impulses manifested in the primitive and fundamental
forms of incest tendency, sons would cohabit with their
mothers, daughters with their fathers. In such unions one of
the partners would be relatively aged, and the offspring would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
in consequence very probably be lacking in that degree of
vitality or health normally possessed by the children of parents
of more equal age; they would moreover fail, in the majority
of cases, to enjoy that degree of provision and protection
which could be afforded where <em>both</em> parents are still youthful.
Even if such unions were to occur, they could not (in the case
of one sex at any rate) be continued in the following generation;
for if a son were to cohabit with his mother and if a male
child resulted from their union, this child could not in turn
fruitfully unite with his mother (who would also be his grandmother),
as she would be now definitely past the reproductive
age. Further, such unions would come into opposition with
the almost universal tendency to find sexual attractiveness in
youthful rather than in aged persons&mdash;a tendency which, like
the appreciation of beauty in the opposite sex in general, we
may suppose has been shaped largely, if not wholly, by the
operation of natural selection, which has ensured that men and
women should in the main be attracted to those who are most
likely to produce strong and healthy children.</p>

<p>Thus it can easily be understood that any races which
tended to indulge to any large extent the impulses which
prompt to incestuous unions between parents and children
would be at a disadvantage as compared with those races in
which these unions did not occur or occurred less frequently;
the latter races tending therefore to supplant the former. Given
then the existence of a strong impulse towards parent-children
unions, we can see how biological factors may very well have
favoured the growth of strong counteracting factors, such as
manifest themselves in the repression of the tendencies towards
this form of incest.</p>

<p>These considerations would of course apply not only to
relations between parents and children but to all other unions
in which the age difference between the partners is considerable.
They would not however apply to unions between
brother and sister or between cousins who are of approximately
equal age. The influences which lead to the aversions to these
latter unions must be sought elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>



<p>(6) A potent set of influences calculated to inhibit tendencies
<span class="sidenote">Fear of the
consequences
of parental
jealousy</span>
to incest are those connected with sexual jealousy. A boy's
love towards his mother, as we have seen, almost necessarily
brings him to some extent into conflict with his father, while
a girl's affection to her father is similarly calculated to bring
about the jealousy of her mother. This arousal of jealousy on
the part of the parents may produce repression of the incest
tendency in the child in a variety of ways; of which perhaps
the most frequent and important are:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>a.</em> fear of punishment at the hands of the jealous
parent, and</p>

<p><em>b.</em> unwillingness to cause injury or sorrow to this parent
because of genuine affection being felt towards him (or her)&mdash;affection
which of course may quite well co-exist with very
considerable jealousy and rivalry. Both these motives appear
prominently in psycho-analytic investigations of the conditions
underlying the repression of the Œdipus complex in normal
and neurotic persons of the present day, and both have been
operative for long ages in the past wherever the family has
existed in a monogamous form in which the parents lived
together for a considerable period after the birth of their
children. Very similar motives may also co-operate in the
repression of incest tendencies as between brothers and sisters,
the jealousies in this case being for the most part those
between brothers or between sisters respectively.</p>

<p>(7) There can be little doubt that there exists a certain
<span class="sidenote">Strong family
ties conflict
with social
development</span>
degree of antagonism between the development of strong and
permanent ties within the family and the development of those
sentiments and feelings which bind the individual to the larger
social groups, such as the tribe or nation, or those which make
him a prominent, useful and agreeable member of society&mdash;in
that family affections conflict in some degree with gregariousness.
This antagonism can be observed in society to-day in such
cases as those in which dependence on, and attachment to, the
family will prevent an individual from easily adapting himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to the wider environment of school, college or club life, or from
becoming "at home" in the circle of his business, sporting or
professional acquaintances. Similarly, undue concentration of
interest or affection on the family will very frequently prevent
the formation of those wider sublimations, some of which we
studied in Chapter XIII, sublimations upon which the successful
working of a large community may often depend. The individual
who finds the satisfaction of all his emotions and desires
within the circle of his family is unlikely to develop to the full
those wider interests in his fellow men and in the social
conditions of his age and place, without which all higher
political progress and development become impossible.</p>

<p>At an earlier stage of human society the conflict was very
possibly much more acute. Man, as we have seen, was probably
in origin a family, rather than a social, animal; nevertheless
it is the gregariousness of man which is responsible for the
most characteristic features of the progress in culture which
has led to civilisation. Gregariousness has therefore proved
itself a very precious biological possession and natural selection
would be likely to ensure its retention and development in the
human mind, thus affording a strong influence in favour of the
repression of those family affections which might threaten it.
It is to some extent in this way perhaps that there came about
that great revulsion against the monogamic family which is manifested
in the totemic age&mdash;an age in which the ties connecting
the individual with other members of a larger social group
were developed at the expense of those which attached him
to his family, and an age which elaborated the most complex,
far-reaching and intense barriers against the incest tendencies
which are shown in the various systems of exogamy.</p>

<p>At a later stage of human development, when the foundations
of society were more securely settled, circumstances seem
to have permitted something in the nature of a relaxation of
the restrictions on family ties and family affections, the exogamic
rules becoming less strict or less far-reaching and the family
becoming more firmly knit together; this change being perhaps
made possible by the fact that the larger and more complex
social groups of a more developed society no longer came into
such direct conflict with the family as an alternative social
unit&mdash;the larger group being now of sufficient size and strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to tolerate the co-existence of the smaller (or, more strictly
speaking, to include the smaller within itself) without fear of
competition or disruption.</p>

<p>Thus, though the urgency of the pressure may very well
have varied in different times and places, it would seem
probable that the claims of social life have constantly exercised
some influence in restricting the interests and affections which
centre round the family and have therefore probably constituted
one of the forces which have helped to bring about that inhibition
of the incest tendencies for which we are here trying to account.</p>

<p>(8) There exists a very similar antagonism between a high
<span class="sidenote">They conflict
also with
individual
development</span>
degree of family attachment and the claims of individual
development. We have seen in the earlier chapters the way
in which the full unfolding of the individual's capacities&mdash;his
ability to maintain himself by his own efforts, his power of
self reliance, of initiative and of independent thought and
action&mdash;demand a relaxation of the ties that bind him to his
family. It is true that the relations of an individual to his
family which are here in question are not primarily the erotic
ones; still they are everywhere in contact with these erotic
aspects of the family relationship and would seem to be highly
correlated with them&mdash;so much so that it is often a matter of
great difficulty to decide where the erotic elements end and
the purely dependence relationships begin<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>. In virtue of this
correlation it would seem that the incest tendencies, when
developed or retained in a high degree, must be inimical to
the free growth of individual capacity; in other words, that
those communities in which the incest tendencies have flourished
would, other things equal, consist of less energetic, self-reliant,
and efficient individuals than those in which these tendencies
had been kept within more moderate bounds. Natural selection
would therefore, we might expect, ensure the continuation of
those communities in which the incest tendencies were more
repressed. Similarly, as regards the individuals themselves, it
would seem likely that, in virtue of their greater efficiency,
those would survive and prosper who were able to control
and to sublimate their incest tendencies rather than those in
whom these tendencies had free and unrestricted play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the last heading (7) we saw that the repression
<span class="sidenote">Both greater
integration
and greater
differentiation
of society is
thus secured</span>
of incest would on the whole lead to the greater integration
of human society through a more developed gregariousness
and the establishment of firmer ties of interest and affection
between the individual and the community. Under the present
heading we have seen that the repression of the incest
tendencies would also lead to greater differentiation through
a more thorough development of individual characters, abilities
and differences. If, with Herbert Spencer, we agree that the
progress of society (like evolution generally) involves both
integration and differentiation, it is easy to see how the
inhibition of the tendencies to incest may have thus contributed
in two distinct but complementary ways to the advance of
human civilisation.</p>

<p>(9) Westermarck, as we saw above (3), in endeavouring to
account for the origin of incest horror, drew attention to the
aversion to sexual intercourse between those who had lived
together from early youth (a class of persons which usually, of
course, includes the closer blood relatives). While we must disagree
with Westermarck in his implicit denial of the underlying
attraction between these persons&mdash;an attraction which makes
the aversion in question to a large extent nothing more than
a reaction against the desire for intercourse between them&mdash;it
is nevertheless possible that the study of this wider aversion
may throw a few rays of fresh light upon the narrower incest
aversion with which we are concerned.</p>

<p>Westermarck would regard the objection to intercourse
<span class="sidenote">Among those
who live
together sexual
reactions
are inhibited
by non-sexual</span>
between those living together from youth as due to the
biological causes discussed above (3). Without denying the
truth of this view, we may venture to suggest that there
perhaps exist psychological causes, which tend to bring about
the same result. Those who live much together must necessarily
react in and to each other's presence in a great variety of
ways, involving a very considerable number of instinctive and
habitual mechanisms, the majority of which are not&mdash;or at most
are only quite indirectly&mdash;sexual in nature, being concerned
for the most part with life preserving activities (<em>e. g.</em> obtaining
and preparing food, eating, washing, dressing, acquiring or
practising various branches of skill or knowledge, the carrying
on of professional activities, <em>etc.</em>). During the greater part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
their time together, the sexual instincts of the persons concerned
are therefore held in check in order that the other mental
trends involved in these various necessary functions may enjoy
full play; in fact the reaction to each other's presence along
the lines of these other trends becomes much more habitual
than does reaction along the lines of sexual feeling. The very
constant inhibition of this latter feeling occasioned by the
almost continual preoccupation with everyday affairs, in which
those who live together are equally concerned, is apt to make
it difficult for the inhibition to be entirely removed and for
the sexual trends to have free play, even when opportunity
offers; and is therefore calculated to make a union between
those whose lives have long been intimately connected appear
unsuitable or unattractive, quite apart from the operation of
any definite taboo or prohibition; whereas with strangers inhibitions
of the kind just described are far less operative and
the sexual impulses can therefore work without impediment.</p>

<p>A further factor which may reinforce the foregoing is
<span class="sidenote">and especially
by hostile
tendencies</span>
connected with the actual hostility (conscious or repressed) that
so frequently exists between those whose lives and interests
are connected. As we have already had occasion to see, the
competition that exists between members of the same family
is almost bound to engender some degree of hostility; and this
hostility (even if in later life it be quite indiscernible to consciousness)
will add its weight to any force which tends to
inhibit love of the person towards whom hostility is felt.</p>

<p>Here then we have two factors, which, though not peculiar
to incestuous relationships, nevertheless very probably contribute
a certain share of influence to the sum total of the forces
productive of the aversion to incest<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>(10) The incestuous tendencies with which we are here
<span class="sidenote">The incest
tendencies are
also affected
by the general
sexual
inhibitions</span>
concerned are, as we have amply seen, among the earliest
manifestations of sexuality (in the wide sense of this term
commonly employed by psycho-analysts) and, like most other
manifestations of this aspect of human nature, suffer from the
general repression to which sexuality in all its more direct
expressions is habitually subject. It is no doubt true that the
incestuous direction of the youthful sexual impulse itself
contributes in very appreciable measure to the conditions which
bring about this general repression, and that this repression is
therefore to some extent an effect rather than a cause of the
incest inhibition. Nevertheless it would seem at least equally
certain that incest inhibition is far from being responsible for
the whole of sexual repression and that the latter does react
powerfully in certain respects upon the former, so that the
existence of a general tendency to the repression of all manifestations
of the sexual instinct may be regarded as constituting
an additional factor in the inhibition of incestuous
affection for which we have been trying to account<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>We have now studied some of the principal factors which,
<span class="sidenote">Thus the
circumstances
of human life
are responsible
for the
mental conflicts
that
centre round
the incest
tendencies</span>
it seems, may have had some influence in producing the
tremendous conflicts in the human mind which centre round
the family. In so far as we have been correct in our analysis
of these factors, it would appear that there are strong influences,
both in the individual and in the race, which work both
positively and negatively in regard to those aspects of love
and hate which constitute the Œdipus complex. The existence
of the mental struggles which this complex inevitably brings in
its train may therefore, on a wider view, appear less startling
than on a first approach. Both the human individual and the
human race are subject to conditions, some of which favour
one mode of response, some of which are best reacted to by
a contrary or at least an antagonistic type of behaviour. Owing
to the inherent limitations of the human mind at the unconscious
and primitive levels&mdash;its difficulty in overcoming habits
that have once been formed, its tendency to give expression
simultaneously to incompatible impulses, its relatively small
power of creating distinctions and differentiations&mdash;it is inevitable
that the different tendencies which are thus created and aroused
should frequently come into conflict. It would seem to be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
especially the function of consciousness however to produce
a clear distinction between different situations and thus to
facilitate nicer adaptations of conduct than would otherwise be
possible. By understanding his own impulses and the true
nature of the situations which have called them forth and to
which they are adapted, man becomes to some extent master
of his own fate and can rise above the blind level of instinctive
behaviour, inasmuch as his own motives become co-ordinated
and integrated and subject to the best that is in him; while
his conduct becomes more delicately adapted to his environment
and more nearly productive of the ends that he desires. It is
as contributions, be they ever so slight, towards this wider
understanding and control of man's nature, that, from the
practical and ethical point of view, studies like the present
acquire such value as they may possess.</p>

ETHICAL AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS&mdash;LOVE AND

<p>Having now completed our theoretical survey, it may be
<span class="sidenote">Practical
conclusions</span>
well to undertake, as a final instalment of our task, some brief
consideration of the main practical conclusions that emerge
from our psychological study of the family relationships. The
general nature of these practical conclusions has indeed already
emerged with some degree of clearness at various points in
our review; but a recapitulation or reconsideration of the
chief points as regards which the psychological processes and
principles with which we have been concerned would seem to
admit of, and to demand, practical application, may perhaps
prove of some value, now that we have reached the end of
the descriptive and theoretical portions of our task.</p>

<p>It is probable that the chief practical gain that may result
<span class="sidenote">They have to
a large extent
already
emerged</span>
from the study of the psychology of the family will ensue more
or less directly from the mere increase in understanding of
the nature of, and interactions between, the mental processes
that are involved in the family relationships. As in most
matters in which the Unconscious plays a leading part,
knowledge is here perhaps more than usually akin to virtue.
A fuller grasp of the essential character of the unconscious
tendencies that are aroused within the family circle makes
possible, and naturally leads up to, an important and far-reaching
readjustment of our views and our behaviour, and a
readjustment of such a kind as could scarcely be brought
about by any other means. When we have brought to consciousness
the hidden motives that lurk in the buried strata of
our mind, our practical judgment and our reason have a grasp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of the psychic situation of such a kind as was before
impossible; and very often the true course to be steered
appears with unmistakable clearness before our vision as the
<span class="sidenote">as usual in
psycho-analytic
investigations</span>
result of our increased self-knowledge. This is only an instance
of what so frequently&mdash;one might say generally&mdash;occurs as the
result of psycho-analysis; not only in the case of psycho-analytic
research into the processes of the individual mind,
but also to some extent in the case of the general treatment
of a problem or a situation upon psycho-analytic lines. That
too is the reason why, in the present case, the practical
conclusions to be drawn from our considerations have to a
very large extent emerged of themselves in the course of these
considerations and have in the main become evident to us
without any further procedure being necessary to elicit them.</p>

<p>Thus it will by now have become amply clear, what, in
<span class="sidenote">The two chief
processes
demanding
ethical
consideration</span>
the main, are the pitfalls to avoid in the course of family life,
and what are the chief ends which it is desirable to seek. The
weaning of the child from the incestuous love which binds it
to the family (together with the secondary hatred which this
love may entail) and the gradual loosening of the psychological,
moral and economic dependence of the individual on
the family have revealed themselves as the two chief aspects
of the task with which the ethical treatment of our subject
has to deal. The considerations brought forward in the last
three chapters have shown that human beings are subject to two
opposing tendencies in these respects&mdash;one of these tendencies
uniting the individual closely to the family, the other separating
him sharply from it; both tendencies being conditioned by
psychological and biological factors of fundamental significance.
It is the duty of a sane and reasonable ethics of the family
to indicate the most satisfactory solution of the conflict which
these opposing tendencies engender, giving such scope to
either tendency as may be necessary for it to fulfil its
essential function in the life of the individual and the race.</p>

<p>Our treatment of the subject during the greater part of
<span class="sidenote">The tendencies
towards the
family more
primitive than
those away
from the family</span>
this book, following as it does the actual findings of those
who have been brought face to face with these tendencies in the
course of their endeavours to understand and cure the disorders
of mental growth and personality, has no doubt conveyed to
some extent the impression that it is the first mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
tendency&mdash;that which draws the individual <em>towards</em> the family&mdash;which
is most often found in excess, and has therefore most
frequently to be restrained, while it is the tendency <em>away</em> from
the family which is most often deficient in strength or in
development, and which therefore most frequently requires
<span class="sidenote">The latter more
often require
artificial aid</span>
artificial stimulation and encouragement. This impression is
indeed one that is inevitably conveyed by a careful study of
the knowledge that we at present possess upon the subject.
In whichever direction we look, Man's chief handicap, as regards
those aspects of his mind which here concern us, would appear
to consist in an undue strength, or at any rate an undue
persistence, of an infantile attitude towards the family. This
would seem to indicate that the tendency towards the family
is probably both ontogenetically and phylogenetically the older
and more fundamental of the two, and that the tendency away
from the family is not yet sufficiently deeply rooted or
assimilated in the human mental constitution to be able to
assert itself with sufficient force in the manner and direction
that successful biological adjustment would require.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if this is so, the mere fact that the tendency
<span class="sidenote">But the former
are biologically
deeper and
more essential</span>
towards the family is thus in some respects prior to, and more
fundamental than, its antagonist, would indicate that it is based
upon biological and psychological conditions and requirements
that are correspondingly more primitive and therefore more
essential. We have seen in effect that the causes which have
led to the strong attachment of the individual to the family are
probably connected with certain necessary conditions of human
growth and development&mdash;the long period of helplessness and
immaturity, the dependence upon others (and especially the
parents) for the very necessaries of life, the need to learn
from others, the need for an early arousal and outward direction
of the love impulse, <em>etc.</em> The causes which underlie the tendency
away from the family&mdash;such as the need of casting off the
dependence on the family in order to attain a full measure of
individuality, the antagonism between the family attachments
and the wider social bonds, the value of sexual sublimation for
the advance of culture, the possible dysgenic effects of
inbreeding&mdash;these are in the main connected with less pressing
and immediate conditions of existence; conditions which are no
doubt of great importance for the ultimate fate of the individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and the race, but which are not essential for the immediate
preservation and growth of the individual in his early life, and
which frequently involve a diminution rather than an increase
in immediate benefit or pleasure; representing, as they do,
biological values of a higher and more complex order, which
come into operation only when those of a more primitive kind
have been attained.</p>

<p>If this is so, it would seem fairly clear that our practical
<span class="sidenote">The family
attachments
must be outgrown rather
than destroyed</span>
efforts must on the whole be directed to aid the process of
weaning the individual from his family attachments rather than
to any attempt at preventing or destroying these attachments
themselves. The tendencies that bind the individual to the
family are probably too deeply rooted in Man's nature to yield
to any such direct attack; and in any case, in spite of a
character in some respects archaic, it is almost certain that
they still perform a necessary and beneficial part in the process
of psychical development&mdash;a part for which no adequate
substitute could easily be found; so that it would be undesirable
to eliminate the operation of these tendencies, even if such
elimination were within the bounds of possibility. Thus it
would seem that all schemes and attempts that have been
made, from Plato onwards (and probably long before him),
with a view to preventing the development of the feelings that
centre in and are aroused through connection with the family,
are doomed to failure:&mdash;practical failure, because these feelings
are too strong, too intimate and essential a part of human
nature to be successfully and permanently inhibited by any
alteration of environment<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>; moral failure, because the development
of certain of the most important aspects of human character
are, in their origin and first appearance, bound up with these
feelings and would probably fail to ripen if these feelings were
abolished.</p>


<p>It would then be a hasty and disastrous conclusion if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
were to infer from the widespread occurrence of insufficient
emancipation from the family ties that it is our duty to
<span class="sidenote">Family love in
early years is
necessary for
individual
development
and happiness</span>
endeavour to prevent the formation of these ties or to deal
harshly and destructively with them as soon as they make
their appearance. It would be as useless, as it would
be cruel and unwise, were we to attempt to abolish the
relationship of love and dependence that binds together parents
and children, brothers and sisters: such a course, if it ever
attained a reasonable measure of success, would almost certainly
create evils greater than those which it was intended to avert.
The love of the parents towards the child is assuredly one of
the most essential and desirable features of a child's environment,
if the child's moral and emotional development is to
proceed harmoniously, spontaneously and easily. The lack of
such love during the early years may give rise to a lasting
sense of injury, a permanent feeling of a void or loss in some
essential aspect of the emotional life, leading in its turn to an
insatiable craving for the affection that was not forthcoming
during that period of growth in which it was so urgently
required; or again, it may cause a lifelong bitterness or
hostility towards the parents (and through them towards
mankind in general) for having withheld the love, appreciation
and encouragement which the young child so much desires
and needs; or once again, it may lead to a turning inward of
the child's affections, when these meet with no response, so
that the individual becomes self-centred and narcissistic,
bestowing solely on himself the interest and affection which
under happier circumstances would have been available for the
pleasure and profit of those with whom he comes in contact;
or finally it may lead to serious delinquency or be responsible
for a whole career of crime.</p>

<p>Far therefore from attempting to inhibit or destroy the
love of parent and child, it becomes necessary on the contrary
to emphasise the need, and indeed the moral right, of every
child to develop its affections in this manner, and to urge again
the plea now being put forward by the more thoughtful class
of social reformers, that every child should be born in such
conditions as to make it possible and likely that he will receive
such measure of care and affection as he stands in need of. The
unwanted child&mdash;the child who for social, psychological or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
economic reasons, is not welcomed by his parents,&mdash;starts life
under a disadvantage in this respect, a disadvantage that may
sometimes lead to the most serious consequences both to himself
and to society<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>.</p>

<p>The same considerations make it evident that especial care
should be paid to those children who, for one reason or another,
are unable to enjoy the advantages of normal family life&mdash;care
to ensure that they should have available suitable substitutes
for the parents of whom they are deprived and that they should
receive the due quantity of love which their moral and psychological
development demands.</p>

<p>Although it is necessary thus to urge both the inevitability
and the desirability of the love relationship between parent
<span class="sidenote">Family hatreds
however are
undesirable,
when intense
and prolonged</span>
and child, our attitude towards the hate relationship, which so
frequently accompanies the child's early love, need not in all
respects be similar. The early arousal of love in connection
with the parents or their substitutes is, we have maintained,
essential for the proper unfolding of the emotional and moral
characteristics, and is therefore to be desired, even apart from
the immediately pleasurable and beneficial aspects of this love
both to parent and to child. The corresponding hatreds are
certainly not in themselves either pleasurable or beneficial, and
their undesirable consequences are often, as we have seen, all
too clearly obvious.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there can be little doubt that certain
<span class="sidenote">though to some
extent inevitable
and necessary</span>
tendencies and affects (useful and necessary under certain
conditions&mdash;such as anger or those feelings that are aroused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
by rivalry and competition) receive in this manner a stimulation
which is not without its beneficial aspects. The tendency to
revolt, in particular, is one of the most valuable aids to progress
and the earliest manifestations of this tendency must necessarily
have reference to the home. A child who never disobeyed his
parents and who never felt their authority as irksome would
in all likelihood be sadly deficient in individuality and initiative
in later life. For this reason the arousal of a desire to rebel
against the parents (with the accompanying feelings of hostility)
is not in every case to be condemned. Indeed, as we have
already shown, the incompatibility between the desires and
points of view of children and of adults makes such a tendency
to rebellion and hostility to some extent inevitable. It is only
when this hostility is frequently and violently aroused that the
benefits are not commensurate with the disadvantages. In every
case moreover it would seem desirable that the tendencies to
rebellion and hostility should not be concentrated on the family
circle but should, as soon as may be, seek an outlet in some
other direction, where they will be less liable to constant
stimulation (a state of affairs that is obviously undesirable) and
less likely to give rise to unprofitable and dangerous mental
conflicts.</p>

<p>A great part of the hostility which a child feels towards
the parent of his own sex is, as we have seen, due to jealousy.
This jealousy is, in all probability, to some extent an inevitable
accompaniment of the love the child feels towards the parent
of opposite sex and&mdash;like the more sensual aspects of that love
itself&mdash;is destined to disappear from consciousness in the course
of normal development. Here it would seem that the aim of
our endeavour should be to prevent the excessive arousal of
this jealousy, which if too strong would bring about a serious
tendency to fixation at the stage of primitive parent-hatred.
<span class="sidenote">How they can
be minimised</span>
To achieve this end much can be done by the maintenance
within due bounds of the love relationship between the child
and his parent of the opposite sex; if the love of the child
towards one of his parents is developed in excess, the hostility
towards the other parent is apt to be correspondingly developed.
Again, the early arousal of affection between the child
and his parent of the same sex will act as the strongest and
most natural preventive of hatred. General harmony within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
family, and particularly between the two parents, is also an
advantage, since under these conditions the child is less likely to
look upon the parent of his own sex as a tyrant or an intruder, to
whom the other parent unwillingly submits. For this reason the
divorce or separation of parents, whose marriage is unhappy, may
often be of very considerable benefit to the child and is by no
means, as is sometimes urged, an unmitigated evil.</p>

<p>Apart from these general measures any conduct which
needlessly stimulates the jealousy or envy of the child should
be avoided. Thus, parents should not unnecessarily and
excessively demonstrate their affection for one another in the
presence of their children, particularly in such a way as to
make the latter appear neglected or left out in the cold. The
more directly sexual relationships between the parents are
almost inevitably painful or embarrassing to the children; and
should not be too openly manifested in their presence or within
their hearing<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand the maintenance of strict and unnecessary
<span class="sidenote">Sexual
enlightenment</span>
secrecy as regards these relationships, or as regards sexual
matters in general, is also very undesirable. The child's
curiosity and envy are, by any such procedure, artificially
stimulated, and a child will sometimes bear a lasting grudge
against the parent who has refused information on this subject
or who has resorted to deception. On the contrary, the
advantages of perfect frankness and openness on sex matters
(especially as regards enquiries made by the child) are often
abundantly apparent, and are increasingly recognised by all
those who have devoted their attention to the subject<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>.</p>

<p>A matter of no less importance is that parents should
<span class="sidenote">Parental jealousy</span>
beware lest any feelings of jealousy which they themselves
may harbour with regard to the children, should be allowed
to exercise an undue influence over their own conduct. There
is less excuse for the existence of such feelings in the parent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
than there is in the child, inasmuch as the former possesses,
or should possess, greater integration and maturity of mind
and a more thorough understanding of the nature of his acts
and of their consequences; and in addition there is less real
cause for jealousy, since the parent is himself responsible for
the child's existence, and since, with the superior capacities of
the adult, he has less need&mdash;at any rate within a happy
marriage&mdash;to fear the child as a serious rival for the affections
of his partner.</p>

<p>In spite of all such precautions however, it is probable
<span class="sidenote">By suitable
measures the
friction between
parents
and children
can be greatly
reduced,
though never
entirely
abolished</span>
that it will always prove an impossibility to prevent altogether
the arousal of some degree of hostility on the part of the child
towards the parent of his own sex. The nature of the
antagonism between the two individuals in question is too
deeply rooted in human motives and human institutions to be
without some consequences even under the most favourable
circumstances. All that can reasonably be hoped for is that
such degree of jealousy as may be unavoidable may throughout
be held in check by feelings of affection, and that it may
eventually pass away, with the gradual weaning of the child
from the exclusive direction of its love towards the other
parent.</p>

<p>Still less perhaps can parents expect to avoid altogether
the arousal of hatred due to causes other than jealousy. The
only method of doing so would be to refrain from all
appreciable interference with the child's tendencies and impulses,
while fulfilling all its wants. This, however, is an obvious
psychological, social and ethical impossibility. The desires of
the child conflict too much with the comfort of the parents
and with the established usages of society to be allowed free
play, and even if the granting of free play were possible, it
would not be in all respects desirable, since the proper education
of the child undoubtedly requires some degree of extraneous
interference. Nevertheless we are beginning to realise that such
interference need often be less irksome than was previously
supposed. The old idea that education, to be profitable, must be
unpleasant, is now probably abandoned by all thoughtful students
of education, even in its application to early childhood&mdash;a period
in which the extreme immaturity of the mind and the
remoteness of its aspirations from those of the culture the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
rudiments of which it is starting to acquire would seem to make
the process of training almost necessarily difficult and disagreeable.
Dr. Montessori and others are showing how the education
of the young child can be brought about both more effectually
and more pleasantly by the substitution of guidance for
restriction, and by linking on the activities which have to be
learnt to those in which the child naturally and spontaneously
indulges; while the possibilities of education on similar principles
in the case of older children have been very successfully
demonstrated in the case of the George Junior Republic and
the Little Commonwealth. In so far as the more general control
and instruction exercised by parents can be conducted on the
same lines, the friction between parents and children that
arises as a consequence of this necessary control will tend to
diminish, though the total avoidance of such friction will
scarcely ever be attained.</p>

<p>All that we have here been saying as regards the desirable
<span class="sidenote">The ties between
parents
and children
must be
loosened as
the children
grow up</span>
relationship between parents and children has primarily
reference only to the early years of childhood. As the child
grows up, considerable modifications of attitude and conduct
will of course be necessary. Particularly is this the case as
regards the nature of the love between parents and children.
It would seem necessary indeed, as we have just pointed out,
that the stage of incestuous object-love should be passed through
by the child; it is both useless and undesirable to throw
unnecessary obstacles in its way. But, as we have also seen,
when this necessary stage has been successfully attained, there
remains the far more difficult task of proceeding to the further
stages of object-love which involve a weaning of the child from
the original incestuous object and a corresponding readjustment
of emotional attitude on die part of the parent. A wise parent
will thus do all that is possible to avoid a too enduring concentration
and fixation of the child's affections on himself (the
parent). He will see that suitable opportunities occur for the
due arousal of love and interest in other directions and will
not himself encourage the fixation of his child's love at the
incestuous stage by a too ardent reciprocation of tenderness or
affection.</p>

<p>It is here perhaps more than at any other point that our
standards of conduct require revision in the light of psychoanalytic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
experience. Elsewhere the lessons of psycho-analysis
<span class="sidenote">The necessity
for this has
been very
insufficiently
recognised</span>
for the most part merely reinforce educational aims and aspirations
of which we had already and independently become
aware; but as regards the necessity for the gradual weaning
of affection between child and parent, our responsibilities had
been anything but clear, and there can be little doubt that
many well meaning parents have in the past all unwittingly
jeopardised their children's future by an unwillingness to loosen
the close ties of affection and dependence which were
appropriate in infancy, but which are prejudicial to the full
development of personality in later life.</p>

<p>It may indeed from certain points of view appear touching
or even admirable, when, for instance, a mother and a son or
a father and a daughter have remained strongly and intimately
attached to one another long after the son or daughter has
reached adolescence or maturity. In what direction, it might be
asked, could the child be more appropriately drawn by ties of
deep and permanent affection than to one to whom it owes
its very existence, to whom it is indebted for the care,
nourishment, and protection that were necessary to it in its
early years and who is responsible for the first awakening and
the first reciprocation of its love? We now know, however, that
the maintenance of such a tie when the biological causes that
bind child to parent have ceased to act, is liable to be achieved
at the cost of some grave failure of development. The "good"
son or daughter frequently becomes a bad husband or wife, an
inferior individual and an unsatisfactory member of society.
The conduct of the child who thus sacrifices the unfolding of
his own personality to a primitive affection which should have
been outgrown, should indeed arouse pity or contempt rather
than admiration, while the corresponding conduct of the parent,
who thus hinders the development of the child he loves, can
be regarded scarcely otherwise than as ignorantly and
pathetically selfish.</p>

<p>In order to avoid such conduct it will be necessary for
<span class="sidenote">The loosening
of the filio-parental
tie
requires a
readjustment
of the parent's
life</span>
parents to keep a close watch, not only on the development
of their children's emotional life, but on the course and
direction of their own affections. Only by the gradual replacement
in the parent's mind of that love and interest which centred
round the child by a corresponding absorption in some other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
direction (whether in other children, in the sexual partner or
in some totally different matter) can the necessary readjustment
of the filio-parental relations be successfully and painlessly
accomplished. This is a duty which, difficult as it may sometimes
appear, the requirements of the true mental development
of their children would seem inevitably to impose on parents.
For this reason it is obviously unwise for parents ever to
immerse themselves to such an extent in their children and
their children's affairs, that these absorb the whole of their
emotional and intellectual capacities. If they should do so, it
will be additionally difficult for them to pick up the threads
of their previous interests and activities when the growth of
the children renders such a readjustment necessary<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>.</p>

<p>Supposing that fixation of the love impulse upon the
<span class="sidenote">Displacement
of the parent-regarding
tendencies</span>
actual person of the parent has been successfully avoided,
there remains the possibility of fixation upon the numerous
parent substitutes that we considered in Chapter X. These
fixations really imply, as we have seen, an incomplete
detachment of the erotic impulses from the parental images as
they exist in the Unconscious, and should not occur in cases
where real freedom from the secret domination of these images
has been achieved. Nevertheless we must remember that such
freedom is at best only relative; the associative connections
that bind the earliest to all subsequent objects of love (either
directly or through a series of intermediate links) would seem
<span class="sidenote">Complete
emancipation
from incest
tendencies is
never
achieved</span>
never to be really broken; in all probability they continue
throughout life to exercise a certain measure of influence upon
the direction of the affections. All that we can reasonably
demand under these circumstances is that these unconscious
forces shall not so blind the individual as to cause him to
bestow his love upon an object which is intrinsically unsuitable.
So long as this is avoided there is little to complain of, and
it would seem very probable that a deeper psychological and
ethical insight into the nature of the processes concerned will,
on the whole, produce a relaxation rather than a further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
restriction of the liberty that is now permitted in these matters.
This at any rate would appear to be the direction in which
moral sentiment is moving as culture increases; the maximum
of restriction is reached in those communities where, as in
parts of Australia, a highly complex system of exogamy allows
only a very limited range of choice for the selection of husband
or wife; from this point upwards in the scale of development
there is a marked tendency for the number of forbidden
relationships to become smaller as culture advances, and there
<span class="sidenote">These tendencies
become
less repressed
and more
influenced by
reason, as
development
proceeds</span>
is every reason to suppose that in the main this tendency is
still at work. Indeed we have only recently witnessed an
example of its action in this country in the removal of the
ban upon the marriage with a deceased wife's sister.</p>

<p>The same result emerges if we consider the matter, not
from the point of view of sociology, but from that of an
enlightened system of morality. The evidence available shows,
for instance, that little if any harm is likely to ensue from the
marriage of first cousins, so long as the stock is a healthy
one: much the same is probably true as regards the marriage
of half brother and half sister or even full brother and sister.
Our condemnation of such unions is due to influences emanating
from the repression of the incest tendencies, and not to any
sound appreciation or experience of their ill effects; and in so
far as the taboos consequent upon repression give way to
more balanced moral judgments based on a real understanding
of the issues involved (and this is the general tendency of
ethical development), the disapproval of these unions between
near kin will be continued only in so far as real dangers are
to be apprehended from them. Among such real dangers there
may be found the biological one of the possibility of inferior
offspring, especially in the case of families with marked
hereditary defects, and the psychological one of too little
emancipation from the family influences, with all the consequences
that this may involve. As regards this latter, however,
it will have to be recognised that complete emancipation may
often be beyond the bounds of possibility and that it is often
advisable to permit some degree of indulgence to overstrong
unconscious tendencies, so long as this indulgence is not too
persistent or too definitely pathological.</p>

<br />
ETHICAL AND PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS&mdash;DEPENDENCE
ASPECTS</h2>


<p>All that we have said with regard to the weaning of the
<span class="sidenote">Our conclusions
with
regard to the
love and hate
aspects hold
good for the
dependence
aspects</span>
child from the love relationship that binds him to the family
applies with but little alteration to the dependence relationships.
During his earliest years the child is necessarily
dependent on his parents (or their substitutes) both for the
actual means of his subsistence and for guidance and protection.
As he grows up however (as we have seen specially in
Chapters III and IV) the dependence on his family should
gradually diminish, so that at maturity he should be able in
most respects to face the world as an independent individual.</p>

<p>The duty of the parents, or failing them of the community,
<span class="sidenote">The duty of
parents to
provide for
offspring now
well
recognised</span>
in regard to the provision of material necessities for offspring
is now sufficiently recognised, so that there is little need to
insist upon it here. We may perhaps only suggest in passing
that the profound and complex nature of the satisfactions
which parents have in their children, and which we had
occasion to refer to in Chapter XIV, would very possibly
make the communistic rearing of children on a large
scale as unsatisfying and inadequate from the point of view of
the parents as it would probably be from that of the children
themselves.</p>

<p>The duty of the parents or their substitutes in the direction
<span class="sidenote">The necessity
for the gradual
loosening of
the dependence
tie is
however not
fully realised</span>
of gradually weaning the child from his initial condition
of dependence has however received less adequate recognition
nor has the difficult and delicate nature of this duty been
sufficiently appreciated. On the economic and social sides
indeed it is admitted that it is incumbent upon parents to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
provide their children with the means of earning their living
and of taking their place generally among their social equals;
though with regard to girls the views as to what was
necessary as regards education for these purposes has, up till
comparatively recently, often been lamentably narrow. In this
country there is even now in many quarters a failure to realise
the full nature of parental responsibilities with regard to
daughters; much less financial provision being frequently made
in their case, both for higher and professional education and
for the expenses incidental to marriage, than in the case of
sons; lack of adequate provision in these respects inevitably
tending of course to produce an undue degree of dependence&mdash;economical
and moral&mdash;on the parents.</p>

<p>If, on the economic side, the duty of weaning children
<span class="sidenote">especially as
regards the
psychological
aspect of this
tie</span>
from their primitive dependence on the family is thus not yet
always fully recognised, the recognition of the corresponding
duties on the psychological side is still less complete. Parents
are often unwilling to abandon the jurisdiction and control
which they have been accustomed to exercise over their
children and which may have become very pleasant to them,
both as providing an agreeable source of interest and as
ministering to their sense of power. Often too in the beginning
it may be easier for them to help their children than to let
the latter learn to help themselves. Not infrequently also they
are directly or indirectly encouraged in this course by the
children themselves, who, out of laziness or failure in initiative,
prefer that their lives should be regulated by their parents
rather than that they should make the effort and take on the
responsibility of regulating it themselves. Sometimes, moreover,
parents are unwilling to relinquish the management of their
childrens' lives for fear of the disasters that may overtake
these latter through ignorance and inexperience; or again because
of an exaggerated tenderness which makes them loth to
abandon those manifestations of affection which parental
assistance may imply. It must be understood however that
none of these motives&mdash;powerful though some of them may
be&mdash;provide an adequate excuse for the omission to carry out
the weaning process, which, as we have seen, is of such vast
importance for the development of the full capacities of the
individual. It can scarcely be too frequently emphasised that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
parents who bring their children up without regard to the
necessity of this emancipation are guilty of a very serious
neglect of their childrens' welfare<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The danger is perhaps greatest in the case of strong
<span class="sidenote">The danger is
greatest in the
case of parents
of strong
personality</span>
willed, self-assertive and energetic parents, who in any
case, as we have seen, are likely to exert a powerful influence
over their children, and who, by an undue insistence on
the authority which they possess, may easily cripple all
initiative on the part of these latter. In parents who themselves
are weak and averse from serious effort there is
<span class="sidenote">though there
may be difficulties
also in
the case of
weak parents</span>
naturally less likelihood of this occurring: in such cases the
danger lies more frequently in the direction of their devoting
too little time, trouble or guidance to their children: or else
in their adoption of a changeable and inconsistent attitude&mdash;petting,
indulging, spoiling and bribing one minute, bullying,
nagging and punishing the next; being now overstrict, now
easy-going.</p>

<p>Here, as in the case of the love-weaning, it is difficult or
<span class="sidenote">Necessity of
parental
readjustment</span>
impossible for parents to carry out satisfactorily the steps
necessary for the gradual emancipation of their children, except
in so far as they are able to make a corresponding readjustment
of their own emotions and tendencies. New interests
and occupations must gradually take the place of those that
formerly centred round the children; otherwise there is likely
to arise a blank in the affective life, which may lead to much
unhappiness and even to neurosis.</p>

<p>In considering the question of the emancipation of children
<span class="sidenote">Too prolonged
parental jurisdiction
is a
cause of filio-parental
hatred
in later life</span>
from the authority and influence of their parents, it is well to
bear in mind also that it is the exercise of this authority and
influence which affords the principal occasion for the development
or continuance of the hatred of children towards their
parents in adolescent or adult life. The arousal of some hatred
in the early years of childhood may indeed be inevitable. Its
continuance into later life, with all the misery that this is apt
to entail, may probably in nearly every case be avoided,
provided that the stage of infantile jealousy has been successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
surmounted and that the child is endowed with something
approaching the usual degree of amenability and sympathy with
the point of view and susceptibilities of others; the rest is very
largely a matter of the careful relaxation of parental authority
and of the granting of reasonable and ever increasing amounts
of liberty and of opportunity for self-guidance and self-control.</p>

<p>What we have here said as regards the necessity for the
<span class="sidenote">The dependence
of children upon
parent-substitutes
must also be
gradually
reduced</span>
gradual relaxation of parental control applies of course not
only to the parents themselves but to their substitutes&mdash;guardians,
nurses, teachers and others who are placed in similar positions
of trust and authority. There is indeed reason to believe that in
these quarters the necessity of emancipation is often more in
need of emphasis than among actual parents. Particularly is
this the case with regard to certain institutions, where children
would seem to be brought up with but little freedom or
opportunity to learn the nature and conditions of autonomy
or to adapt themselves to the varied circumstances of the outer
world. In many of our schools also there is to some extent
a lack of proper understanding or application of the principles
which demand the gradual relaxation of parental and quasi-parental
authority. Though here, as a rule, the evil is in
practice less serious than it would at first appear to be; the
granting of autonomy and the cultivation of responsibility and
self-control in some directions usually compensating in large
measure for the petty and foolish restrictions to which
adolescent boys and girls, or even fully grown young men and
women, are subjected in some of our larger and better known
educational establishments.</p>

<p>These last considerations point the way to certain wider
<span class="sidenote">The ethics of
the family
must however
be brought into
connection
with wider
social
questions</span>
issues that are connected with the ethics of the family&mdash;issues
with which we have already been brought face to face in
Chapters XIII and XIV, and which we need therefore only
refer to here by way of recapitulation. We have seen in these
chapters that there exists a correlation between certain aspects
or stages of development of the family on the one hand and
certain forms of social or ethical institutions or organizations&mdash;particularly
in the sphere of education, politics and religion&mdash;upon
the other. Inasmuch as the attitude of the individual
towards his teacher, his social or political superior, or his God,
is to a very considerable extent derived from, and dependent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
on, that of the child towards his parent (the former attitude
being a displacement of the latter), it is obvious that moral
considerations and decisions with regard to the relationship of
parent and child cannot altogether be divorced from the wider
questions involved in the relations of the individual to his
religious, social, and educational environment.</p>

<p>Thus it would be, in the main, a foolish and useless
proceeding to urge, as we have done, the desirability of a
<span class="sidenote">Our ethical
conclusions in
the two cases
must harmonise
with one
another</span>
gradual emancipation of the growing child from the controlling
and protecting influences of the parents, unless we are at the
same time willing to permit a corresponding growth of autonomy
in school and college. Again, if we were right in assuming
a connection, on the one hand between a highly developed
<em>patria potestas</em> and a relatively stable and unprogressive
political condition, and on the other between the relaxation of
parental authority and a state of rapid political development
and loosening of governmental authority, then it would (in
the absence of any counteracting influence) be absurd to
demand the complete emancipation of the individual from his
family, if at the same time we desired to uphold autocracy
in government or to increase the stability of political and
social forms. Nor, once more, would the encouragement of
children to become independent of their fathers be logically
compatible with the maintenance of a religion of the Judaic
type, in which the severe and all-powerful Father-God is but
a displacement of an earthly father whose stem authority is
unquestioned within the bounds of his own family. It must be
realised that our attitude in the one case must be brought into
harmony with our views in the other. Our ultimate conclusions
as to what is desirable within the family must be arrived at
only after due consideration of their wider outside bearings;
and again, our opinions on these wider issues may profitably
be reviewed in the light of the knowledge that is gained
by a biological and psychological study of the family.</p>

<p>In the present pages we have followed in the main the
<span class="sidenote">The extent of
this harmony</span>
latter course. Nevertheless it would appear that on the whole
the conclusions we have arrived at by this method are not in
any way seriously incompatible with the general tendencies of
contemporary thought. While recognising the necessity and
desirability of the family influences in early life, we have for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the most part demanded emancipation of the individual from
any such growth and retention of these influences as would be
liable to hamper or delay his personal development. This is
well in harmony with the tendencies which are manifested
nowadays towards freedom in education, with the analogous
tendencies aiming at the overthrow of autocracy and the
establishment of democracy in politics and with the growing
toleration and increasing abandonment of the Judaic attitude in
religion.</p>

<p>In education there would seem to be almost complete
<span class="sidenote">in education</span>
agreement between the implications of our own conclusions
and all the more modern and progressive tendencies in
discipline and teaching; it is only with the antiquated remains
of systems that are now universally condemned by all reformers
that there remain any serious elements of conflict.</p>

<p>In religion the agreement is also very considerable, though
<span class="sidenote">in religion</span>
perhaps less thoroughgoing; there are perhaps many who
would still retain the notion of a quasi-anthropomorphic Father-God
as an extra-mental reality, even though the purely mental
origin of such a God has become apparent.</p>

<p>It is in politics however that such discrepancy as there
<span class="sidenote">in politics</span>
exists is perhaps most apparent. Although the primitive
political father&mdash;the autocrat&mdash;would seem to be rapidly disappearing,
it is fairly clear that there exists a tendency to
resurrect some of the parental attributes and give them a
political application by bestowing them upon the State. The
world-war has taught us the necessity of implicit obedience to
the State and its representatives&mdash;military and civil; the right
of independent thought, action and criticism being to a large
extent suspended and the minute details of our lives being
subject to order and inspection in much the same way as in
our childhood they were subject to the supervision of our
parents. Again, modern socialistic thought&mdash;especially in its
cruder aspects&mdash;has produced a state of mind, as a result of
which the individual becomes to a large extent absolved from
the responsibility for his own education, progress and maintenance,
or for those of his children. The adult individual is
thus led to transfer on to the State that attitude of dependence
which he originally adopted in relation to his parents, failing
to this extent to attain that full degree of self-reliance and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
independence which we have had in view in considering the
gradual emancipation of children from their parents. In these
respects it would seem that the conclusions arrived at in the
course of our study of the family would point to a rather
larger measure of Individualism than is contemplated by the
great body of contemporary political thought. If our conclusions
are correct, there is a danger in too wide a ramification of
state provision and state control, inasmuch <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'at it'">as it</ins> is liable to
prevent that full development of individual power, initiative
and self-reliance which can only be obtained by a high degree
of emancipation from the primitive attitude of dependence on
the parents. If, on the other hand, it is considered that the
advantages of a far-reaching and complex state organization
override those attending the full development of individuality,
it is obvious that our ethical conclusions with regard to the
family may have to be correspondingly revised.</p>

<p>There remains but one more set of ethical considerations
<span class="sidenote">The
individual's
relations to
his family in
later life</span>
to review before we finally take leave of the reader. Supposing
that the relations of the individual to his family environment
have successfully passed through the stages we have outlined
and that the individual has at maturity attained the desirable
degree of emancipation from, and independence of,
the influences emanating from his family, there remains
the problem of defining more precisely the nature of his
relations to his family after he has reached maturity.
It is evident enough from our previous considerations that
these relations will be loose and far from binding. It is
also fairly clear that they must be such as to be capable of
being broken altogether without causing any very considerable
<span class="sidenote">They must be
capable of
being broken
altogether</span>
amount of distress or inconvenience to any of the parties
concerned. Sooner or later these relations are necessarily
broken by the great divider Death, and even before this final
and inevitable separation, distance, diversity of occupation or
other considerations may place the members of a once closely
knit family entirely out of touch with one another. According
to our principles it is obviously desirable that these unavoidable
<span class="sidenote">though it is
natural that
some relationship
should be
maintained</span>
separations should involve no element of bitter regret or
paralysing sorrow.</p>

<p>Supposing however that circumstances are such as to
make possible relations of some degree of intimacy between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the members of a family, all of whom have reached maturity,
what will be the desirable extent and nature of this relationship?
Presupposing always a satisfactory previous history on
the lines we have considered, there would seem reason to
think that some kind of relationship will, and should be,
usually maintained. The common interests, affections and
associations formed during a lengthy and highly important
period of life will, in the absence of reasons to the contrary,
usually constitute sufficient ground for the continuance
throughout life of the intimacies that have been formed
between those who lived so long together and have so long
been subject in varying degree to each other's influence.</p>

<p>We must remember, however, that there very often <em>are</em>
<span class="sidenote">except where
(as often happens)
there
are definite
reasons to the
contrary</span>
reasons to the contrary. In many cases, for instance, the love
or dependence fixations in an individual's mind are such that
continued intimacy with the parents will seriously detract from
that individual's capacity to make the best of life. Frequent
meeting with the parents may sap his energy or deprive him
of initiative and self-reliance in the manner we have studied:
or again, it may cause serious interference with his love life,
as where the constant arousal of the not wholly outgrown
love impulses to father or mother may appreciably diminish
the affection available for husband or wife respectively, thus
producing an unhappy marriage. For similar reasons frequent
meetings between brothers and sisters may often be disadvantageous.
Still more clearly is it undesirable to continue
family intimacies where not love but hatred is the predominant
tendency aroused and fostered by these intimacies. In such
cases it is evident hypocrisy for the parties concerned to meet
more often than is absolutely necessary: the frequent stirring
up of conscious or unconscious hatred can only cause
unhappiness, unprofitable and dangerous mental conflict or
deterioration of character; and the more that relatives who
are unable to "get on" with one another keep apart, the
better it will be for all concerned.</p>

<p>With these wide and sweeping reservations however, it
would probably seem to accord best with psychological and
sociological considerations if at any rate some moderate degree
of connection be maintained between relatives, whom
circumstances have not definitely set apart. Given freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
from all undesirable fixations (whether of hatred or of love),
brothers and sisters have at least as good reasons for being
permanently helpful and agreeable to one another as have
friends who have been intimate with one another in the course
of school, college, social or professional life. Still closer perhaps
in some ways are the bonds that may permanently unite
parents and children. The long period through which they have
been bound to one another by ties that are biologically
justifiable and necessary would seem to produce a psychological
effect that inevitably tends to persist in some degree throughout
the remainder of life. The relations of child to parent and of
parent to child are so fundamental to all human existence and
human intercourse, that most, if not all, of our mental life, in
so far as it has reference to our fellow creatures, is to some
extent reminiscent of them, or affected by them. We can never
root out from our mind the tendencies connected with this
most intimate and essential of human connections; and this
being so, it would only be in accordance with the most
fundamental promptings of our nature to permit a certain
proportion of the energy involved in these tendencies to
continue to flow in its original direction.</p>

<p>This is not to say however that the manifestations of this
<span class="sidenote">But the relations
between
parents and
children must
undergo
profound
modification
as time passes</span>
energy will not undergo considerable alteration as time passes.
As children grow up and parents grow older, the former
increase, the latter decrease in natural strength and ability of
mind and body. In course of time therefore the attitude which
parents and children naturally and reasonably adopt towards
each other must gradually change to suit the varying conditions.
At first children are dependent on the guidance and protection
of their parents, who must make the necessary efforts to help
and rear their offspring. Later on this differentiated relationship
should give place to one in which parents and children are
on equal terms. Finally, the original relationships may become
to some extent reversed and, if parents and children are still
within reach of one another, the former may come to look to
the latter for some return of that help and protection that they
themselves had previously afforded.</p>

<p>In this last situation, we see a form of the relationship,
<span class="sidenote">The care of
the aged by
their children</span>
which appears to be peculiar to human society. Throughout
the animal world and even in many primitive human communities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
there is no thought or care or tenderness devoted to old age.
The increasing moralisation of human character (in which the
relationship between parent and child has probably played a
<span class="sidenote">is culturally
very desirable</span>
leading part) has brought it about that at least some degree
of attention is given in all civilised societies to the needs&mdash;material
and mental&mdash;of those who are no longer able fully to
support themselves or to carry on their life without assistance.
In any society in which the family is a permanent and firmly
organised social unit, the duty of caring for the aged will
naturally fall to some extent upon their children. This care of
elderly, lonely or infirm parents by their children may perhaps
legitimately be considered one of the most beautiful and
touching expressions of specifically human morality&mdash;a point in
which Man has definitely risen superior to the conditions of a
brutal struggle for existence. As such it both deserves, and
stands in need of, every encouragement and support which a
developed and enlightened system of practical Ethics can afford.</p>

<p>It is not however free from <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'certains'">certain</ins> ethical difficulties of
its own. Thus, it might seem at first as though the care and
<span class="sidenote">though it has
of necessity its
limitations</span>
attention that a person of mature age may bestow upon his
parents is but a just and reasonable return for the benefits
which he himself received from these parents in his infancy and
youth. Biologically however the cases are not similar. The
care of parents for their young is necessary for the perpetuation
of the race. The care bestowed upon the aged and infirm
who are no longer able to provide adequately for themselves
is of no direct value in the struggle for existence; it may even
be a disadvantage in this struggle, a luxury that can only be
afforded when the struggle is relaxed or when all competing
individuals or races have adopted the practice. Further, from
the point of view of the race, the real equivalent that is given
in return for the benefits received from parents in early life
lies in the corresponding benefits bestowed upon the next
generation in its turn, and the double burden of maintaining
and caring for both the young and the old may be definitely
beyond the powers of many.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it but rarely happens, even at the extreme
end of a long life, that the old are entirely dependent upon
the care and efforts of others. In a civilised society they
usually remain permanently able to provide for a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">Satisfactory
family conditions
conduce to
happiness in
old age</span>
part of their immediate needs, and the sounder and more stable
is their own and the general economic condition, the more is
this the case. On the whole it is perhaps rather on the
psychological than on the strictly economic side that they
will be in need of assistance, and here it is that the
principles that have emerged from the study of the facts and
tendencies with which we have been concerned in this book
may prove of use. In so far as family life is able to proceed
and develop on the lines which a true morality based on sound
psychological principles and an adequate psychological knowledge
would seem to indicate as most desirable, it should be possible
for the older members of the family to participate freely in
the joys and satisfactions which they may still find within the
family circle and to escape the danger of being excluded from
these satisfactions, by the disappointments and misunderstandings,
or by the unhappiness and bitterness that the faulty
development of the family so frequently, and so disastrously,
brings in its train. The old tend always to live to some extent
vicariously: they find a great part of their interests and their
pleasures in the contemplation of the doings of others who
are younger than themselves: their own lives are projected
into those of their children and their grandchildren, and by
means of this projection they enjoy the most natural compensation
for the decline of their own personal interests and
capacities. If they have found this compensation, it may well
be said that life's concluding chapter has shaped itself for them
in a form as satisfactory as any which it is granted to human
nature to enjoy.</p>

<p>With these considerations regarding old age we may
<span class="sidenote">Conclusion</span>
appropriately end. The subject of the human family is a
mighty theme, of which no full treatment has been attempted
here. If I have illumined certain aspects of the subject, if I
have led the reader to realise something of the depth and
complexity of the problems involved and of their vast
importance for human weal and woe, nay, even for human
existence, I shall have accomplished all, or more than all, that
I set out to do. We have seen that, just as on the biological
side the family is an essential factor in the development and
preservation of the human race, so too on the psychological
side, the thoughts, feelings and impulses that centre round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
family belong to the most intimate and fundamental part of
Man's spiritual nature. If we are to understand this nature
and to control and mould it wisely in order that we may
achieve those ends in life which seem to us desirable, it is
very necessary that we should have a full and accurate
knowledge of the way in which the mind is influenced by, and
in its turn reacts upon, the forms, circumstances and conditions
of the human family. It is this which makes the subject of this
little volume one of such supreme importance.</p>

nature of the methods, discoveries and hypotheses of the psycho-analytic
school, except in so far as they directly touch our present problem. Some
at least of the general principles underlying the work of the school together
with some of the results they have achieved are now becoming fairly well
known. Those who would pursue the subject further may be referred
to the following books: Brill, "Psychanalysis," 2nd. ed. 1914; Ernest
Jones, "Papers on Psycho-Analysis," 2nd. ed. 1918; Pfister, "The Psychoanalytic
Method," 1917; White, "Mechanisms of Character Formation," 1916;
Barbara Low, "Psycho-Analysis," 1920. A more detailed study would include
reference to Prof. Freud's own works, of which the principal are:&mdash;"Selected
Papers on Hysteria," 1909; "Three Contributions to the Theory
of Sex," 1910; "The Interpretation of Dreams," 1913; "The Psychopathology
of Everyday Life," 1914; "Wit and its Relation to the Unconscious," 1916;
"Totem and Taboo," 1918; "Vorlesungen zur Einführung in die Psychoanalyse,"
1918; also four volumes of the "Sammlung kleiner Schriften zur
Neurosenlehre," published at various times, and two volumes in the series
entitled "Schriften zur angewandten Seelenkunde". For the meaning of the
term Unconscious see Hart, "The Conception of the Subconscious," <em>Journal
of Abnormal Psychology</em>, 1910, Vol. IV, 351. Hart's small book "The Psychology
of Insanity," 1912, affords an excellent general introduction to abnormal
psychology. (Here as elsewhere the titles and dates of English translations
of foreign works are given, wherever such translations are available.)</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The dreams falling within this class (together with some others)
appear to exhibit what is, at first sight at least, a puzzling exception to the
general rule governing the formation of dreams which give expression to
repressed tendencies, inasmuch as the obnoxious wish is gratified openly
and undisguisedly instead of appearing in an indirect and symbolic form,
as is usually the case. It would seem however, that this departure from
the rule may to a large extent be explained and reconciled with the
ordinary methods of repression by the following considerations:&mdash;(1) although
the content of the wish appears directly in consciousness, it nevertheless
fails (both during the dream and after waking) to be appreciated in its full
significance for the mental life of the personality, <em>i. e.</em> there is no realisation
of the fact that the dream represents in any way the fulfilment of a wish;
there is present a sort of functional agnosia, in virtue of which the thought
of the death is dissociated from its actual psychical concomitants, which
alone can endow it with its full meaning; (2) in addition to this cognitive
dissociation there is an emotional substitution, the emotion actually experienced
being one of sorrow instead of one of joy, which the simple
gratification of a wish would by itself most naturally occasion. This sorrow
corresponds of course to the very genuine grief which would be felt at
the conscious level in case of any real mishap to the relatives concerned
and at the same time serves as an additional screen to hide the underlying
hostile wish in the Unconscious; (3) on rarer occasions it would seem that
the process of emotional substitution may be replaced by one of
deëmotionalisation which prevents the cognitive elements from calling
up any of the feelings which would normally accompany them; thus the
death of a near relative will appear not as a sorrowful (or as it would
be at certain levels of the Unconscious, a joyful) event, but as one
devoid of all affective significance or as one that is absurd, ridiculous or
unthinkable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Or sometimes, in the case of women, the Electra complex; though
the Electra myth gives a rather less complete expression of the combined
love and hate tendencies in the female than is found in the Œdipus story
for the corresponding tendencies of the male.</p>

<p>The whole subject of the manifestations of these complexes in legend
and literature and in the mind of the poet and the artist is treated at
length in Otto Rank's comprehensive and most valuable work "Das Inzestmotiv
in Dichtung und Sage".</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> This is a most important and far-reaching limitation. In order to
avoid entering upon many difficult but weighty matters which are not
strictly relevant to our present theme, we have here&mdash;and throughout the
book&mdash;necessarily had to content ourselves with a somewhat one-sided and
misleading portrayal of human psychic development as a whole. This
deficiency is most marked with regard to the treatment of the great group
of self-preserving and self-regarding tendencies, which we have only
touched upon occasionally and of which we have nowhere attempted any
adequate presentation. As a consequence of this, it must be borne in mind
that from the point of view of general psychology, we have frequently
laid too much stress upon the object-regarding tendencies (see below), to
the relative neglect of much that is more primitive and fundamental in
human nature. Our excuse must be that our subject naturally brings us
into far closer touch with the social and (to use a convenient term of
Ferenczi's) allo-erotic aspects of the mind than with those other aspects
which are more intimately concerned with the individual as an independent
microcosmic organism. To correct and amplify the inadequate conception
of the human mind and of human mental development to which our present
treatment might lead if taken by itself, the reader should consult Freud's
"Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex" and his important paper "Zur
Einführung des Narzißmus," <cite>Jahrbuch der Psychoanalyse</cite>, VI, 1. The works
of Alfred Adler, though often both exaggerated and, especially in their
English form, very nearly unreadable, contain some interesting material in
this connection.</p>

<p>A very illuminating consideration of the problem with which we are
immediately concerned at this point&mdash;the early development of object love
in the child and the relations of this object love to the activities of the
auto-erotic stage&mdash;will be found in a paper on the "Psychology of the New
Born Infant" by David Forsyth. (To be published in the <cite>British Journal of
Psychology</cite>).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> Mr. Cyril Burt, who possesses both abilities and opportunities of an
exceptional degree as regards the observation of children, has suggested
to me that two types of transference corresponding roughly to different
stages of development, should be distinguished in this connection. In the
first type (characteristic of children of between 4 and 9) there is a well
marked displacement of the erotic or quasi-erotic aspects to some older
person, usually of the opposite sex, while the child continues to feel
tenderness for the parent. In the second type (characteristic of children
of 10 up to the period of adolescence) the attitude towards the love object
(parent substitute) is more reverential, tenderness being complicated by
submissiveness and fear and the affection being in general far less physical
and demonstrative than in the first type. "The attitude" adds Mr. Burt,
"of emotional girls in Standard II and Standard V respectively toward
their teachers seems to me typical. The former maul and kiss (if allowed):
the latter reverence from afar."</p>

<p>If this distinction be generally true, it would seem that there are two
main stages of displacement of the parent regarding feelings:&mdash;(1) in which
the more erotic elements are displaced, the more tender aspects of affection
being still directed to the parents; (2) in which these latter are in their turn
transferred, in whole or in part, to new love objects.</p></div>

that it absolves us from the necessity of taking literally many of the more

symbolism with which we have been here concerned&mdash;that in which an
unconscious (repressed) thought or tendency is expressed by something
more permissible to consciousness, and that in which the thing expressed
is of as high or even higher cultural value than the thing through which
it finds expression, Ernest Jones has, in the chapter already referred to
("Papers on Psycho-Analysis," 129 ff.) proposed to confine the term
symbolism to the former class, all examples of the latter class being
included under the term metaphor.</p></div>

aspects of the family relationships and those here under consideration
(which for the sake of convenience we may call the dependence aspects),
although employed throughout this essay, is made primarily for purposes of
exposition and is not intended to imply that the distinction is in fact so
sharply cut as the present method of treatment might possibly suggest. In
real life the sexual and the dependence aspects are inextricably interwoven,
and it is probable that the majority of psycho-analysts would be inclined
to lay somewhat less stress on the distinction than does the present
writer.</p></div>

example in most of those technically described as "mentally deficient"
and in many of those technically described as "backward"&mdash;who do not
readily acquire interest in the details of a process leading to a desired
end, apart from the end itself (<em>i. e.</em> in whom work does not become
pleasurable for its own sake), or in those in whom there is no strong self
feeling associated with the idea of successful achievement. The granting
of an undue amount of assistance will, however, in its turn tend to retard
or prevent the formation of these desirable mental characteristics.</p></div>

had never been able to leave home without the most intense feelings of
sorrow and loneliness, which usually impelled her to return precipitately
after the absence of a day or two. In childhood she could seldom be
induced to go more than a mile or so from her home unless accompanied
by her parents and in later life neurotic symptoms were developed which
effectually prevented her from living apart from her nearest relatives. As
was to be expected, analysis revealed a very strong parent fixation, and
after treatment she was able to fill a responsible post in a town far removed
from the residence of her family.</p></div>

to stand the strain of circumstances which would present little or no
difficulty in the absence of parent fixation. Thus in a case known to me,
after a happy honeymoon spent near home, a wife proved unable to
accompany her husband to a distant locality, where business affairs
necessitated his residence but (in spite of his protests and entreaties)
turned back while on the journey and returned to live with her parents.
It appeared that she had very seldom left home before her marriage, having
been brought up by kindly but indulgent parents, as regards whom there
was a strong emotional fixation. In her youth she had only travelled once
without her parents, being then so miserably unhappy that she begged to
be sent home again as soon as possible.</p></div>

significance. The child projects on to its parents its own desires, ambitions
and aspirations, thus finding compensation for the gradual realisation of its
own deficiencies, limitations and want of power (in much the same way
as parents in their turn find consolation for their own disappointments
in contemplating the successes&mdash;real or anticipated&mdash;of their children. <em>Cp.</em>
below Ch. XIV.). In this way certain of the Narcissistic impulses find displaced
expression in the idealisation of the parents and the exaggeration of their
powers&mdash;a factor which probably plays a part of great importance in the
Psychology of Religion (<em>Cp.</em> below Ch. XIII.).</p>

<p>The following incident in connection with a young boy personally known
to me amusingly illustrates the tendency to substitute an ideal parent for a
(disappointing) real one, together with the religious and Narcissistic implications
of this tendency. S. F., aged 7, insisted on being called Jesus Christ, in spite
of the remonstrations of his father who pointed out to him among other
things that Jesus Christ was the Son of God; to which S. F. replied "So
am I." On receiving the reply: "You cannot be, for <em>I</em> am your father," he
retorted, "God is my real father, you are only my <em>professional</em> father"
(referring to the fact that his father was a "professional" musician).</p></div>

indulged in phantasies of entering into the bodies of women and girls
whom he admired, the ideas of effecting an entrance into the body, of
being carried therein and of re-emerging therefrom, being all accompanied
by voluptuous feelings of a sexual character.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> A striking example of this is to be found in Sir J. M. Barrie's "Mary
Rose", in which a grown up son, on returning after many years to the
home of his childhood, is earnestly warned and entreated by the housekeeper
in charge of the (now empty) house not to enter his former nursery
(womb symbol), a small room which is approached by a short passage
(vagina symbol). He eventually overcomes his fears and boldly enters the
forbidden apartment with a lighted candle (phallic symbol) in his hand. At
that moment the ghost of his mother appears!</p>

<p>The identification of the processes of birth and coitus is well shown
in the following dream of a patient. "I was with difficulty crawling through
a very narrow tunnel under a mountain which, I thought, was called the
Aalberg. I was a good deal frightened but saw the end of the tunnel a
long way off. In trying to get out, I seemed to force my way forward by
continually butting with my head against some kind of soft wall". The
movement here described is a clear coitus symbol (head = penis), while
the mountain would appear to have derived its name from the phallic
significance of the eel.</p>

<p>In a certain number of cases the idea of returning to the mother's
womb or of being born is coloured by the infantile "cloacal theory" of
birth, according to which the child imagines birth to take place through
the rectum. This is shown with exceptional clearness in the following
dream. "I was walking down a long and narrow flight of stairs. They
seemed to be the <em>back</em> stairs of a large house or hotel and were very
dirty and ill-lit, and every now and then I would tread in a pool of dirty
water. The stairs suddenly (note the words in italics) opened out towards
the <em>bottom</em> and I emerged into a <em>back</em> yard. I found I was covered with
soot and dust and my boots were filthy." (<em>Cp.</em> the well known passage
from St. Augustine, "Inter urinas et faeces nascimur").</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_69_69" id="Footnote_69_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_69"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> It is a question of considerable psychological interest, as to how the
ideas of birth and intra-uterine life come to acquire the significance which
we have found them to possess. In what way for instance do we come to
associate life within the womb with freedom from effort, difficulty or
danger? In the majority of cases, not from conscious thinking on the
subject; on the contrary, the connotation of safety and effortlessness would
seem in some way to belong inherently to the idea of pre-natal existence
from the very beginning, or at any rate to have become attached to it
through a purely unconscious process of association. Again, how do we
come into possession of the ideas of birth and pre-natal life themselves?
Is the knowledge which has gone to the formation of these ideas entirely
acquired after birth, or is there retained in the mind anything in the
nature of impression or memory of that early period of existence in which
gestation and birth were actually experienced? From the fact of the very
general obliviscence which attends the first years of infancy, as well perhaps
as from the relatively undeveloped state of the cerebrum in the newly
born child, we might, with considerable show of reason, be inclined to
disbelieve that any memory traces can be operative. On the other hand, the
surprising fact of the sudden recovery in hypnosis, during psycho-analysis
or otherwise, of early memories which had been entirely lost for many
years, or again the fact that phantasies of birth or intra-uterine life seem
sometimes to refer to details (<em>e. g.</em> the amniotic fluid or the different
stages of labour) of which there is little opportunity to learn in ordinary
life and which play but a small part, if any, in the average adult's
conscious notions on these subjects, have made some writers hesitate to
affirm too strongly the absolute impossibility of such operation. Again
some may suggest that the knowledge which is mysteriously revealed in
these phantasies may compel us to assume the existence of some such
innate ideas as are perhaps involved in Jung's conception of the impersonal
or racial Unconscious, according to which there are present in the unconscious
mind certain materials (capable, apparently, of crystallisation into
ideas of a certain degree of definiteness) which in their origin are assumed
to be independent of personal experience, being, like our more fundamental
instincts and tendencies, derived and inherited from a long line of ancestors.</p>

<p>It is perhaps possible that more exact information on this important
subject might be forthcoming as the result of careful investigations into
such questions as the following:</p>

<p>(1) To what extent (if at all) do children display&mdash;in dreams, phantasies
or otherwise&mdash;knowledge as to the circumstances of their birth and
pre-natal life which they could not possibly have obtained except from
memory of their own past experience?</p>

<p>(2) Do the phantasies of prematurely born children differ in any way
from those of children born at the end of the normal term? If, for instance,
there really exist any memory traces of the later period of gestation or
of the process of birth, it might be expected that they would be less vivid
than usual in prematurely born children, owing to the less developed
condition of their brain at the time of birth.</p>

<p>(3) Are the phantasies concerning birth in any way more vivid or
frequent or of greater emotional intensity in those whose birth has been

<p><a name="Footnote_70_70" id="Footnote_70_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> The following three dream extracts from the writer's own psycho-analytic
experience afford very clear examples of the kind of dream to
which reference is here made.</p>

<p>(1) "I was trying to catch a train, but a gate leading to the
platform was closed and I could not succeed in opening it. Then
my father suddenly appeared, shook the gate violently, opened it
and hurried me across the platform. He opened the door of a compartment
and pushed me in. I found a lady sitting there." The lady
here was associated with the mother and the opening of the gate and
door symbolised the sexual act.</p>

<p>(2) "An elderly man" (father symbol) "led me upstairs" (coitus
symbol. <em>Cp.</em> Freud, "Interpretation of Dreams," p. 252) "to the interior of a
church or chapel" (mother symbol). "Here hymns were being sung"
(initiation ceremony) "I thought I ought to sing too, but had some bother
to find the right place in the hymn book. Then one of the people said to
me 'You are one of us.'"</p>

<p>(3) "I wanted to get into a house, but could not find the way in.
Suddenly our doctor" (in this case, as so often, a father substitute) "came
along and said: 'A doctor always goes in by the window'. From a bag he
brought out a long elastic instrument" (phallic symbol). "with which he
opened a window on the first floor" (symbol of sex intercourse). "We
entered and I found it was my mother's bedroom. The doctor said 'You
should now go to sleep' and I prepared to go to bed."</p>

<p>As will be seen from these examples, the initiation idea may be
easily combined with the idea of returning to the mother's womb discussed
in the last chapter. This combination is perhaps still more clearly shown
in the following dream of the patient, who provided Example 2. "I was on
a boat sailing on a river or canal which gradually became narrower and
shallower. Finally the boat grounded on a sandy bottom. I got out and
walked up a staircase into a cathedral where some ceremony was going
on, in which I took part."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_80_80" id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> Sometimes apparently this procedure is very successful. Thus a
well known psychologist has told me: "On passing every illumination
during the night of the Jubilee, my father, who was carrying me, smacked
me 'to make me remember the day'. I was four, and I have remembered!"</p></div>

"keel hauling" those who are crossing the equator for the first time, it is
possible also to trace certain typical symbols of the re-birth phantasy.</p>

<p>The sexual aspects of initiation are apt to be particularly prominent
in the case of boys entering a criminal or anti-social "gang". Thus an
acute student of this subject writes to me: "I have often found that a
delinquent boy was initiated into sexual knowledge and practices on the
first evening that he joined his "gang"; <em>e.g.</em> in one such gang every new
member had to exhibit himself. He was asked if he knew "what it (the
penis) was for"; this was explained; and after certain criticisms were
passed, the leader, after a thorough inspection, declared "you will do".
There was also a catechism: "Do you know what your mother and father
do..." etc; the result being to discredit them in the eyes of the
boy and to lead him to emulate them or at least to defy and despise them."</p></div>

successive falling in love with several persons of the same name, as for
instance, in the case of Schiller (Charlotte von Wolzogen, Charlotte von
Kalb, Charlotte von Lengefeld) or in that of Shelley (Harriet Grove, Harriet
Westbrook and the later affection for Harriet de Boinville). The incestuous
origin of such a name influence may be shown even more clearly in cases
where the names of persons successively loved are those of different
members of the lover's own family; as in the case of Mörike; (Clara and
Louisa, after the name of his two sisters). <em>Cp.</em> Rank, "Das Inzestmotiv in
Dichtung und Sage," pp. 91, 543. In a case known to me, a young woman
fell in love successively with three men possessing the same Christian
name, one of whom had the same surname as herself. In a fourth love
affair the surname of the man was the same as the Christian name of her
brother, to whom she was much attached, and contrary to her usual custom
she always called this fourth lover by his surname instead of by his
Christian name.</p></div>

Psycho-analytic work has drawn attention to the influence that a name may
often exercise upon the behaviour and mental characteristics of its
possessor. (<em>Cp.</em> Stekel, "Die Verpflichtung des Namens," <em>Zeitschrift für
Psychotherapie und medizinische Psychologie</em>, III, Part 2, 1911. Abraham,
"Über die determinierende Kraft des Namens," <cite>Zentralblatt für Psychoanalyse</cite>,

noticed the possibility of this influence.</p></div>

the person of Emilie Bardach of Vienna, who served as principal model
for Hilda Wangel in The Master Builder and who is referred to in the
following description given to his friend Elias (<cite>Neue Deutsche Rundschau</cite>
1906, p. 1462, quoted by William Archer in his Introductions to Ibsen's
plays, Vol. X, p. XXIV) "He related how he had met in the Tyrol a
Viennese girl of very remarkable character. She at once made him her
confidant. The gist of her confessions was that she did not care a bit
about one day marrying a well brought-up young man&mdash;most likely she
would never marry. What tempted and charmed and delighted her was
to lure other women's husbands away from them. She was a little daemonic
worker: she often appeared to him like a little bird of prey, that would
fain have made him too, her booty."</p></div>

men one of great importance consists in the fear of castration which&mdash;as
result of threats by parents and nurses and otherwise&mdash;frequently becomes
intimately associated with the onanistic act. Closely connected with this is
the fact that the significance and consequences of masturbation are more
obvious in the male than in the female&mdash;the emission of semen and the
lassitude that follows this being very liable to produce a sense of loss and
injury, thus easily arousing or reinforcing the fears connected with the
ideas of castration. Perhaps a further factor of a more general nature is
played by the greater freedom of narcissistic impulses in women (<em>Cp.</em>
Freud, "Zur Einführung des Narzißmus," <cite>Jahrbuch für Psychoanalyse</cite>, VI. I.).
The relatively greater persistence of infantile self-love shows itself clearly
in the greater freedom of the milder manifestations of homosexuality in
women (the homosexual partner being a projection of the lover's self;
<em>Cp.</em> above p. 103) and may very well also be the cause of women's more
natural attitude to masturbation as a form of auto-erotic gratification.</p></div>

that the attraction which women often feel for men of a racially more
primitive type, and the corresponding jealousy that the (often subconscious)
perception of this attraction arouses in men of the women's own race,
are among the most important factors which prevent the reconciliation
or co-operation of different races and which are the cause of much of the
brutality and violence which a superior race is apt to exercise towards an
inferior one. (<em>Cp.</em> the frequent lynchings of negroes for real or supposed
sexual offences in America, or the anti-negro or anti-Chinese riots that are
of not infrequent occurrence in English seaport towns.) If this should be
true (and there can be little doubt that it applies to certain cases) it would
appear that we are dealing with a psychological fact possessing historical
and sociological bearings of even wider significance than would at first
appear&mdash;bearings which must be kept in mind in all attempts to produce
rapprochement or better understanding between the different races of
mankind. (For a study of the tendency in question in individual cases <em>Cp.</em>

<p><a name="Footnote_161_161" id="Footnote_161_161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_161_161"><span class="label">[161]</span></a> We may briefly mention here a few of the main lines along which
the evidence for the identification of regicide and parricide proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) The very person who performs the deed of murder is frequently the
one who succeeds to the throne; taking this in combination with the fact
that it is usually the son or some other near relative who is the recognised
successor, it is evident that there exists a natural tendency for the murderer
to belong to the murdered king's own family.</p>

<p>(2) The birth of a son is very frequently associated with the idea of
danger to the father. This danger would appear to be the principal motive
for the widespread custom of killing the king's son, which seems to be
regarded as, in many respects, an alternative to the killing of the king
himself (see Frazer, "The Dying God," Ch. VI, 160 ff.) <em>Cp.</em> the very frequent
legends (of which the story of Œdipus is one) in which a kingly father, to
avoid threatened danger to himself, exposes or otherwise attempts to murder
his young son. See Rank, "The Myth of the Birth of the Hero."</p>

<p>(3) There exist many cases in legend, and some in actual fact, in which
the son fights with his father for the privileges of chieftainship; while in
at least one case (Frazer, "The Dying God," 190) the king is made to abdicate
as soon as his son is born.</p>

<p>(4) In the many quaint practices of the Carnival type, which, as Frazer
has shown ("The Dying God," 205 ff.), usually represent, in one at least of
their aspects, the murder of the king in the shape of the spirit of vegetation,
the death of the old monarch is usually followed, immediately or after an
interval, by general rejoicing at the coming to power of his successor (<em>cp.</em>
the well known phrase, "Le roi est mort, vive le roi") showing that the
idea of the superseding of an outworn potentate is a prominent underlying
feature of the whole type of ceremony.</p>

<p>(5) Festivals of this kind, and indeed those connected with the succession
of kings generally, are usually associated with some kind of sexual orgy, in
which the relaxation of the usual prohibitions, especially those which relate
to incest, is often a prominent feature; this fact seems to point to the
existence of some connection between incest and succession to the kingship,
such as that which is manifested in the myth of Œdipus.</p>

<p>(6) This connection is indicated even more clearly by the widespread
custom of the new king taking over the wife of the king whom he has
succeeded, even if she should be his own step-mother, or in some cases
perhaps his real mother (See Frazer, "The Magic Art and the Evolution of
Kings," II, 283 ff., "The Dying God," 193 ff.). Where (as seems to have happened
not infrequently) this is combined with the murder, deposition or defeat
of the old king, we get both elements of the Œdipus complex in intimate
association, and openly expressed.</p>

<p>(7) Among the prohibitions and conditions to which a king is subject
during his tenure of office, not the least burdensome are those connected
with his sexual life. On the one hand his sexual activities are often restricted,
permitted only under certain circumstances and conditions or even forbidden
altogether; while on the other hand any failure or weakness of sexual power
may be made the reason for his deposition or execution. If the sexual
jealousy, which is such an important constituent of the Œdipus complex,
plays an active part in the attitude habitually adopted towards kings
(especially by those who are likely to become their successors), such
restrictions on the king's sexual activity or such a utilisation of any sexual
failing on his part as an excuse for his deposition or execution are only
what we might expect to find.</p>

<p>In bringing forward these arguments in favour of the operation of the
Œdipus complex in the treatment accorded to kings, we must not of course
shut our eyes to the co-operation of other important motives belonging to
the later and more conscious levels of the mind, such as that emphasised
by Frazer, according to whom the king is regarded as the embodiment of
natural fertility, so that, if he were to become old or enfeebled, Nature (in
virtue of the principles of homoeopathic magic) would suffer from a
corresponding weakness and produce less abundantly; this belief naturally
leading to the desire to kill the king while he is still in his prime, lest in
age or disease he should endanger the sustenance of the community. Such
a motive as this (and perhaps still others) may very well co-exist with the
motives connected with the Œdipus complex, in virtue of the psychological
mechanism of over-determination, just as&mdash;as Silberer, Rank, and others
have shown&mdash;many myths, legends and neurotic symptoms may give direct
or symbolic expression at the same time to two or more distinct sets of
tendencies.</p></div>

is largely the result of the guilty conscience of the living; the feelings of
hostility (including of course death wishes) which the living had experienced
towards the dead during their lifetime being projected on to
the dead (in accordance with the now familiar mechanism, which can be
studied most clearly in psychopathological disorders such as Paranoia;
<em>cp.</em> above pp. 116, 130); as a result of which the dead are conceived as being
on the whole evilly disposed towards the living and consequently to be
feared. Hence the very general fear of ghosts. <em>Cp.</em> Freud, "Totem and

races of savages are ignorant of the rôle of the father in reproduction.
There is much evidence in favour of such ignorance being often very considerable
and sometimes perhaps complete (See E. S. Hartland, "Primitive
Paternity," 1910). Some authors however (<em>e. g.</em> Walter Heape, "Sex Antagonism,"
and Carveth Read, "No Paternity," <em>Jour. Royal Anthrop. Inst.</em> 1918,
XLVIII, 146) have maintained that the facts do not admit of the assumption of
complete ignorance. Read especially has shown that such ignorance as exists
may often be due to social or individual inhibitions, which prevent the knowledge
of the true facts (a knowledge which exists in certain persons even in
primitive communities) from penetrating to the consciousness of the majority
of the inhabitants. If this view is correct, it reveals an interesting parallel to
the fate of sexual knowledge in the individual; psycho-analytic investigation
often showing that knowledge of the facts of sex and reproduction can be
repressed from consciousness, though persisting in the unconscious levels
of the mind. (<em>Cp.</em> Freud, "Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex," 37 ff., 51.)</p></div>

highly tinged with masochistic feeling. As regards mythology, the cases in

being the recognised source of temptations and obsessions of this kind.
The sexual aspects of the Father God are of course throughout chiefly
noticeable in his relations to women and in the attitude adopted towards
him by women. Thus the long series of amorous adventures on the part
of Zeus are typical instances of father-daughter incest. In many places the
cohabitation of a god with a mortal woman, who is regarded as his bride,
has been an essential part of religious ceremonial; though the god himself
is often, conveniently enough, impersonated for this purpose by his priest.
The very widespread practice of religious prostitution seems to be derived
from the same source (<em>Cp.</em> Frazer, "Adonis, Attis, Osiris," I., 57 ff.). That girls
should, before they marry, give themselves to the god, to his representative,
or to some other man under his auspices, may be regarded as a custom
having some relation to the initiation phantasies and ceremonies which we
have already considered; the girl's introduction to sex life being, through
this custom, accomplished by the father, or at least under his guidance and
with his approval. A social parallel to this religious custom is to be found
in the <em>droit de seigneur</em>, in virtue of which the lord of the manor had the
right to sexual intercourse with a bride before she could be claimed by
her husband.</p>

<p>In the Christian Church, owing, we may suppose, to the increasing
repression of the more directly sexual aspects of the father-regarding
feelings, the sexual elements in the religious attitude of women is more
frequently directed to Christ than to God the Father (corresponding to a
brother-sister rather than to the older father-daughter type of affection).
Nevertheless, the persistence of incestuous tendencies towards the father,
can often be observed in individual cases.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_182_182" id="Footnote_182_182"></a><a href="#FNanchor_182_182"><span class="label">[182]</span></a> The repression of the mother-regarding feelings has had its influence
not only on the attitude towards the mother element in religion and on
the attitude towards women in general, but also on everything that is
(consciously or unconsciously) associated with women and especially with
the mother. There is one curious instance of this influence which has been
of very considerable importance in the history of philosophy, science and
of man's attitude towards some of the most important problems of life and
mind. There exists a very general association, on the one hand between
the notion of mind, spirit or soul and the idea of the father or of masculinity;
and on the other hand between the notion of the body or of matter
(<em>materia</em> = that which belongs to the mother) and the idea of the mother
or of the feminine principle. The repression of the emotions and feelings
relating to the mother has, in virtue of this association, produced a tendency
to adopt an attitude of distrust, contempt, disgust or hostility towards the
human body, the Earth, and the whole material Universe, with a corresponding
tendency to exalt and over-emphasise the spiritual elements, whether
in man or in the general scheme of things. It seems very probable that a
good many of the more pronouncedly idealistic tendencies in philosophy
may owe much of their attractiveness in many minds to a sublimation of
this reaction against the mother, while the more dogmatic and narrow
forms of materialism may perhaps in their turn represent a return of the
repressed feelings originally connected with the mother. (<em>Cp.</em> Von Winterstein,
<em>op. cit.</em>)</p></div>

probably played an important part in the history of human culture
inasmuch as it has afforded a ready means of rendering psychic energy
available for the practice of agriculture; the cultivation of the Earth's surface
being from the psychological point of view a displacement of the original
incestuous desires directed to the mother. On the other hand the very
closeness of the association between mother and Earth has in some places
led to a reluctance to till the soil, such an act being looked upon as
impious (See Frazer, "Adonis, Attis, Osiris," I. 80 ff.).</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_198_198" id="Footnote_198_198"></a><a href="#FNanchor_198_198"><span class="label">[198]</span></a> As Freud has pointed out ("Totem and Taboo," 147), there exists a
parallelism, on the one hand between the stage of Magic and Animism and
the Narcissistic level of individual development, and on the other hand
between the stage of Religion and that of the first object-love as directed
to the parents. In Magic man attributes omnipotence to himself, while in
Religion omnipotence is transferred to the gods, or in so far as it is retained
by the individual, can be exercised only through the gods; man no
longer finds the satisfaction of his own needs in and through himself, but
obtains his desires only through his relations with others whom he loves
and venerates.</p>

<p>In religion too however there exist, beside the object-regarding
elements, certain elements which are derived from, and give expression
to, the Narcissistic impulses. God is to some extent a projection of the
primitive mental egocentricity and self-sufficingness which the infant enjoys
before it becomes clearly conscious of the distinction between its own
organism and the external world&mdash;a distinction which necessarily brings
with it a gradually increasing realisation of the individual's limitations and
dependence. Unwilling to give up the primitive sense of power and
importance which a growing insight into reality shows to be unfounded, Man
displaces on to his God the desired qualities which he can no longer
attribute to himself and deludes himself into believing that he can still
attain his wishes, through prayer and similar rites, by merely wishing them
aloud to God. This mechanism is clearly seen at work in those persons
who (like the late Kaiser Wilhelm II) treat their God as a being whose
principal function it is to approve and carry to fulfilment their own
ambitions, schemes and undertakings.</p>

<p>The conception of the Devil also is to a very considerable extent
derived from the Narcissistic impulses&mdash;the individual <em>projecting</em> on to
"the author of evil" those aspects of himself of which he disapproves
(more particularly perhaps the sexual aspects). In this way he, in a sense,
frees his own personality from tabooed wishes of whose operation in
himself he would otherwise become unpleasantly aware, and in this way
absolves himself from the responsibility for actions committed at the
instigation of these wishes.</p>

<p>These self-regarding aspects constitute without doubt a most important
factor in the psychology of Religion and serve to remind us once again
of the limitation of our psychological treatment. They fall outside our present
theme, inasmuch as they take their origin from a mental level phylogenetically
and ontogenetically prior to that at which are developed the psychic relations
of the individual to his family which constitute our subject in this volume.</p></div>

that it manifests itself openly in consciousness, whereas the complex is

seem to show that a surprisingly large number of these have as their
principal motive the death of the child which the mother carries in her
womb. Nor do such death wishes on the part of the mother fail to manifest
themselves on occasion in the mother's waking thoughts and actions.
Abortion and attempts at abortion are of course extremely common
(especially where, through ignorance, carelessness or legislative interference,
the more humane method of preventive sexual intercourse is not
practised), but, even after birth, attempts of one kind or another on the
lives of children are by no means rare, even in civilised societies to-day.
(The practice of infanticide in more primitive communities is of course
notorious). I am assured by one who has good opportunities for observation
on this matter that "practical child murder (by slow and safe
methods) is far commoner than the newspaper reading public imagines:
and it is usually the mother who attempts the process".</p>

<p>As a milder method of disposing of an unwanted child, a mother will
often attempt to leave it in some institution for the care of children. So
much is this the case that almost the first question the authorities of such
institutions have to ask themselves, when the mother brings a child, is
whether she is trying to get rid of it.</p></div>

parents "don't believe in their children having a better time than they
did" and where the children will not infrequently console themselves for
the sufferings they endure at the hands of their parents by the thought of
what they in their turn when grown up, will do to their children.</p>

<p>Often however, the cruelty inflicted from this motive is rationalised
as a desire to avoid spoiling the child and to prepare him for the rough
time that he will have in later life. (<em>Cp.</em> this with the motives underlying
the infliction of punishment at initiation ceremonies among primitive
peoples, p. 83.).</p></div>

without effect upon the mind of the child himself, where it is reinforced
by a variety of other motives, such as:&mdash;the wish to become the parent
of his own parent (<em>i. e.</em> the corresponding notion to that in the mind of
the child's parent which we have just been considering), the wish to dispense
with his parent (<em>cp.</em> p. 109), the projection on to the grandparent of
the grandiose ideas formerly entertained with regard to the parent (<em>cp.</em>
p. 55), and finally the results of the happy relationship that often exists
between child and grandparent (owing to the fact that the grandparents
are as a rule less responsible for the child's upbringing and education and
less stern and vigorous in the assertion of their authority). As a consequence
there may arise in the child a strong tendency to imitate the grandparents&mdash;a
tendency that may constitute an important factor in moulding the
child's beliefs, attitudes, desires, and occupations. <em>Cp.</em> Ernest Jones, "Papers
on Psycho-Analysis," 652, ff.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_212_212" id="Footnote_212_212"></a><a href="#FNanchor_212_212"><span class="label">[212]</span></a> As an example of an attitude obviously akin to one of the main
tendencies underlying the Couvade&mdash;a desire to inflict pain upon the
mother&mdash;we may mention the strong objection that was originally taken to
the use of anaesthetics in midwifery, on the ground that the suffering of
pain in childbirth was a just punishment for sin and that it was therefore
ethically undesirable to seek to do away with or abate this pain.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_213_213" id="Footnote_213_213"></a><a href="#FNanchor_213_213"><span class="label">[213]</span></a> For these reasons it would seem very undesirable to tamper
to any appreciable extent with the motives that may impel a man
to work for the advantage of his immediate posterity; as would be done
for instance, by any prohibition to transmit property to heirs, or by any
measure that too greatly diminished the value of such property, such as
an excessive death duty.</p>

<p>What seems to be to some extent the American ideal of each
generation "making good" in their own persons, is of course based mainly
on perfectly sound ethical and psychological considerations. There is nothing
in these considerations however which is incompatible with the hereditary
transmission of wealth or rank. On the contrary, it would seem to be an
ennobling and inspiring ideal for each generation to start life at a somewhat
higher all-round level&mdash;material and moral&mdash;than the one before
it, each one adding a little to the well-being of the family in body and
mind and handing on the improvement to its successor.</p>

<p>In spite of the great advantages that may thus follow from the
identification of the parent with his children, it behoves us not to overlook
one possible danger that may ensue from it, if carried to excess. An
individual's actions affect posterity, not only in the persons of his own
offspring, but also by their influence on the history of humanity at large;
and it would be highly undesirable if, while contemplating the benefit of
his own family, an individual ceased to bear in mind his duties to the
wider circles of his social environment. The deeds of great men obviously
determine to a considerable extent the future of the race. It is however
the privilege of all of us to contribute to this history to some degree;
hence an enlightened morality must needs emphasise the responsibility
that is incurred in this respect even by the humblest, since, by his actions
during life, he has to some extent made himself immortal, and influenced
the world through all time for good or ill.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_214_214" id="Footnote_214_214"></a><a href="#FNanchor_214_214"><span class="label">[214]</span></a> It may be well to bear in mind in this connection Mr. Bernard
Shaw's striking words from his brilliant essay on Parents and Children
(the whole of which deserves most careful reading). On the subject of
marriage from the point of view of the parents, he writes with his usual
penetration and with a generous understanding of the real difficulties of
the situation:&mdash;"Take a very common instance of this agonizing incompatibility"
(between the point of view of parents and that of the children).
"A widow brings up her son to manhood. He meets a strange woman,
goes off with and marries her, leaving his mother desolate. It does not
occur to him that this is at all hard on her; he does it as a matter of
course, and actually expects his mother to receive on terms of special
affection, the woman for whom she has been abandoned. If he shewed
any sense of what he was doing, any remorse; if he mingled his tears
with hers, and asked her not to think too hardly of him because he
had obeyed the inevitable destiny of a man to leave his father and
mother and cleave to his wife, she could give him her blessing and
accept her bereavement with dignity and without reproach. But the man
never dreams of such considerations. To him his mother's feeling in the
matter, when she betrays it, is unreasonable, ridiculous and even odious,
as shewing a prejudice against his adorable bride.</p>

<p>"I have taken the widow as an extreme and obvious case; but there
are many husbands and wives who are tired of their consorts, or disappointed
in them, or estranged from them by infidelities; and these
parents, in losing a son or a daughter through marriage, may be losing
everything they care for. No parent's love is as innocent as the love of a
child; the exclusion of all conscious sexual feeling from it does not exclude
the bitterness, jealousy, and despair at loss which characterize sexual
passion; in fact, what is called a pure love may easily be more selfish
and jealous than a carnal one. Anyhow, it is plain matter of fact that
naively selfish people sometimes try with fierce jealousy to prevent their
children marrying." p. XXXVIII.</p></div>

of that fear which seems to arise as the result of a transformation of
sexual impulses. On the other hand, it is possible that this too may be
brought under the more general formula, if we recognise that the fear is
in this case directed not to some outer object but to some threatening
element within the mind. For a discussion of this matter see Freud, "Vorlesungen
zur Einführung in die Psychoanalyse," 466 ff. For a most important
discussion of the fundamental nature and conditions of love and hate and
of the different causes from which they originate, see Freud, "Sammlung

opportunities for sexual relations among young people may sometimes be
no greater than under monogamy, since all the available women may be
regarded as belonging exclusively to a certain class of men&mdash;usually
those who have attained a certain age. The hatred and jealousy aroused
in the young men towards their elders may in such cases be equal in
intensity to those felt under monogamic conditions, but the fact remains
that this hatred is no longer intimately connected with the <em>family</em> (at any

by the parents is one of unnecessary or extreme severity, in which almost
every natural manifestation of youthful joy, or vitality is condemned; as is
sometimes the case, for instance, with parents of an ultra-puritanical way
of thinking, whose own mental life, however admirable in other respects,
has been warped by excessive inhibitions. Although marked perhaps by
less bitterness than is usual in such cases, Edmund Gosse's remarkable

<p><a name="Footnote_229_229" id="Footnote_229_229"></a><a href="#FNanchor_229_229"><span class="label">[229]</span></a> We have already (p. 90) given certain examples of that most common
form of incest, the connection of brother and sister. We may here refer
briefly to a few further instances, more especially to those in which there
occurs the more intimate connection between parents and children. Such
instances would seem to have been observed with especial frequency
among the Indians of North America. Thus Samuel Hearne, writing in 1795,
tells us of the Chippewayans that "it is notoriously known that many of
them cohabit occasionally with their own mothers and frequently espouse
their sisters and daughters. I have known several of them who, after having
lived in that state with their daughters, have given them to their sons and
all parties have been perfectly reconciled to it." ("Journey to the Northern
Ocean," 1795, 130). Eighty years later Bancroft tells us much the same of
the Kadiaks ("The Native Races of the Pacific States of North America,"
1875, I, 81). An observer of about the same period writes concerning the
eastern tribes of the Tinnehs that "instances of men united to their mothers,
their sisters or their daughters are far from rare. I have heard among them
of two sons keeping their mother as a common wife, of another wedded
to his daughter, while in cases of polygamy having two sisters to wife is
very usual." ("Annual Report of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution,"
1867, 310).</p>

<p>In South America too the practice of incest of this kind would appear
to have been fairly frequently observed. Thus in Brazil the Indians of the
Isanna river "marry one, two or three wives and prefer relations, marrying
with cousins, uncles with nieces, nephews with aunts, so that in a village
all are connected" (A. R. Wallace, "Travels in the Amazon and Rio Negro,"
1889, 352). Commenting on this report, Frazer adds that "in this preference
for marriage with blood relations the Indians of the Isanna agree with other
Indian tribes of South America, especially of Brazil" ("Totemism and
Exogamy," III, 575). Concerning this same part of the world, another traveller
says that "in general it may be asserted that incest in all degrees is of
frequent occurrence among the numerous tribes and hordes on the Amazon
and the Rio Negro" (See Martius, "Zur Ethnographie Amerikas, zumal
Brasiliens," 1867, 116). Of the Peruvian aborigines we are told by an earlier
authority that they "follow their own desires without excepting sister,
daughter or mother. Others excepted their mother but none else"
(Garcilasso de la Vega, First part of the "Royal Commentaries of the
Yncas," trans. by C. R. Markham, 1869-71, I, 58).</p>

<p>Similar observations have been made by travellers among primitive
peoples in many other parts of the world. Thus with the Karens of
Tenasserim "matrimonial alliances between brother and sister or father and
daughter are not uncommon" (<em>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of
Bengal</em>, VII, 856). In Africa "the kings of Gonzalves and Gaboon are
accustomed to marry their grown-up daughters and the queens marry their
eldest sons" (A. Bastian, "Der Mensch in der Geschichte," 1860, III, 293). In
a district of Celebes "father and daughter, mother and son, brother and
sister frequently lived together in bonds of matrimony" (S. J. Hickson,
"A Naturalist in North Celebes," 1889, 277). With the Kalangs (probably the
aborigines of Java) "mother and son often live together as man and wife,
and it is a belief that prosperity and riches flow from such a union"
(E. Ketjen, De Kalangers, <em>Tijdschrift von Indische Taal-Land en Volkenkunde</em>,
1877, XXIV, 427). Very similar practices have been reported from New
Guinea (Rev. J. Chalmers, "Notes on the Natives of Kiwai," <em>Journal of the
Royal Anthropological Institute</em>, XXXI, II, 1903, 124), the Indian Archipelago
(Wilken, Over de Verwantschap en het huwelijks en enfrechts bij de volken
van het maleische ras, 1883, 277), and Melanesia (Frazer, "Totemism and
Exogamy," II, 118).</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that the frequent practice of incest is
confined to primitive races. Although in civilised communities regarded
with almost universal condemnation, incest has probably always existed to
some extent among certain sections of the population and the practice of
incest among modern white races is undoubtedly much more prevalent
than is commonly supposed. A well known British psycho-analyst assures
me that in the exercise of their profession he and his colleagues hear with
astonishing frequency of cases of incest, the report of which is otherwise
suppressed. Particularly is this so as regards children. At the present day
however, incest undoubtedly occurs most frequently among the poorer
classes, where want of adequate housing accommodation renders the
temptation greater. It is startling to note in this connection that, according
to the Chicago Vice Commission, out of a group of 103 girls examined, no
less than 51 reported that they had received their first sexual experience
at the hands of their father ("The Social Evil in Chicago," 1911, quoted by
W. A. White, "Mechanisms of Character Formation," 1916, 163). Even if we
allow a liberal margin for incorrect or exaggerated statements (in this case
of course, instances of wish-fulfilment), these figures would seem to afford
astonishing evidence as to the prevalence of incest of the father-daughter
type in the towns of America. In this country there is reason to believe
that similar occurrences are far from being uncommon (<em>cp</em>. "Downward
Paths", 20)</p></div>

mechanism in virtue of which men should be attracted to blood relations
strictly as such, though to the present writer it would seem to be a
possibility which should not be entirely lost sight of. Such a tendency
may perhaps have arisen: (1) as the result of some vague and unconscious
sense of affinity, similarity or harmony, based perhaps on an unconscious
memory impression of pre-natal life (in the case of child and mother or
of twins), or upon some other condition of a psychical, physiological or
chemical order; (2) at a higher level through the action of perceived
physical or psychical resemblance, these in turn playing on the Narcissistic
components of the love impulse.</p></div>

with the question as to how an aversion to sexual intercourse between
those who have lived from infancy together changed to a similar aversion
between blood relatives. How is it, if the original aversion was of the
former kind, that it has left but little trace of its existence, while the
aversion to marriage between blood relatives, which is supposed to have
been derived from it, is grown so strong? It would seem as if the theory
would perhaps have to be modified so as to postulate the existence of an
original aversion to the marriage of blood relatives, as such; though of
course this only opens up the fresh difficulty of accounting for the manner
in which such an aversion could arise. We are here faced with the same
problem that we have already encountered in the case of the positive
aspects of the love impulse between relatives (p. 198 footnote).</p></div>

indicated, such influence does not of course, here any more than elsewhere,
necessarily imply any appreciation of the nature of the causes at work. On
the contrary, as some authorities have pointed out, it is scarcely possible
to ascribe to primitive man any conscious realisation of the ill effects of
inbreeding (if these exist). These ill effects manifest themselves much too
slowly to be observed by the savage with his relatively short memory
and his lack of interest in remote events, especially when, as has often
been the case, there has been uncertainty as to the nature of paternity.
Even if the savage were able to realise the nature of this hereditary
influence, it is pretty clear that his actions and feelings would be but
little affected thereby, for it is one of the most general characteristics of
the primitive mind that it takes but small account of distant consequences,
whereas Eugenics involves the appreciation of such consequences in a
high degree.</p></div>

fail to bear in mind that it is admirably adapted for use as a "rationalisation",
<em>i. e.</em> the fear of evil consequences (dysgenic or other) from
marriages between young and old may well be a conscious (and, in a
sense, artificial) substitute for the unconscious aversion to such marriages
on the ground of their being an indirect expression of incestuous desires.
We must therefore be on our guard against the tendency to overemphasise
this argument in the absence of adequate objective evidence.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_262_262" id="Footnote_262_262"></a><a href="#FNanchor_262_262"><span class="label">[262]</span></a> It is round this point of course, as we have above shown, that the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_263_263" id="Footnote_263_263"></a><a href="#FNanchor_263_263"><span class="label">[263]</span></a> That some such factors as these are probably really operative in
addition to the more specific sexual inhibitions that compose the incest
barrier proper, is shown by a consideration of cases in which no such
specific inhibition exists, <em>e. g.</em> that of husband and wife. In spite of the fact
that sexual relations between husband and wife are not only permitted but
enjoined and that mutual sexual attractiveness has usually played some
considerable part in bringing about the union, there can be little doubt that
in very many cases a husband and wife, after a certain period of married
life, tend to find&mdash;superficially at any rate&mdash;greater sexual attractiveness in
strangers than in one another. The reasons for this (in the absence of any
other adequate cause) are often fairly clearly of the kind described&mdash;first,
the fact that their associations with one another are largely connected with
the "humdrum" activities of everyday life in which non-sexual instincts are
principally concerned (whereas with strangers the sexual feelings may
constitute the predominant, or perhaps the only, bond); secondly the fact
that through the very intimacy of their connection there are (as in the case
of blood relatives) a number of matters as regards which the husband and
wife are competitors or have conflicting interests, thus leading to a certain
degree of (usually more or less repressed) hostility on either side.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_264_264" id="Footnote_264_264"></a><a href="#FNanchor_264_264"><span class="label">[264]</span></a> The reasons for the existence of a general sexual repression, over
and above the incest inhibition, and the psychological mechanisms by which
this repression is brought about, form a vast and highly important theme
on which there exists at present but little general agreement and which,
being only indirectly connected with our subject, need fortunately not be
entered into here. It is perhaps worth while to point out however in
passing, that some of the factors which are responsible for the more general
sexual repression are, in all probability, similar to those which we have
considered in connection with the production of incest inhibition. Thus
there would seem to exist an antagonism between a highly developed and
intensive sexuality and those wider social bonds in virtue of which alone
the larger human communities are possible. It is on the basis of the manifestations
of this antagonism that some writers&mdash;as already mentioned&mdash;hold
that the chief motive forces which are active in sexual repression are to
be found in the instincts of the herd. Still more marked perhaps is the
antagonism between sex and individuation. It has long been recognised,
and modern psychological researches have pretty definitely proved, that
many of the more complex desires and activities of the individual&mdash;desires
and activities upon which human culture ultimately depends&mdash;are built up
upon sublimations of the sexual tendencies. All these sublimations involve
a deflection of sexual energy from its original and primitive direction&mdash;a
deflection which occurs for the most part or entirely as the result of conflict
with the sexual tendencies when thus primitively directed.</p>

<p>As regards the motive forces engaged in this conflict, there is again
at present much uncertainty, but they probably to some extent differ from
one case to another. The conflict would seem to be waged, sometimes
between two aspects of the sexual impulse, <em>e. g.</em> between Narcissism and
object-love or between physical desire and tender affection (when these
elements have been dissociated in the ways we have already studied). In
other cases the gregarious instincts are probably engaged in the manner
suggested by Trotter and others; while, in still other instances, there may
be an antagonism between the sexual impulses and the tendencies of self-assertion,
self-respect or self-preservation, as emphasised especially by
Freud. For a more general discussion of the factors concerned in sexual
inhibition, see E. Bleuler, "Der Sexualwiderstand", <cite>Jahrbuch für psychoanalytische
und psychopathologische Forschungen</cite>, 1913, V, 442, and J. C. Flügel,
"On the Biological Basis of Sexual Repression and its Sociological Significance",
<cite>British Journal of Psychology</cite> (<em>Medical Section</em>), 1921, I, 225.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_265_265" id="Footnote_265_265"></a><a href="#FNanchor_265_265"><span class="label">[265]</span></a> It would seem that children who have never known their parents
or any normal parent substitutes, such as those who are brought up
entirely in orphanages and other institutions, nevertheless do actually find
corresponding objects on to whom their parent-regarding tendencies can
be directed; if not in reality, at least in imagination&mdash;imagination that tends
to find a real equivalent as soon as a suitable object presents itself. This
is amusingly and instructively illustrated in Jean Webster's recently
successful book and play "Daddy Long Legs".</p></div>

of these considerations. They add one more argument to the many that
already exist in favour of the practice of birth-control, which is now
adopted by the more cultured classes of nearly all civilised communities&mdash;a
practice the ethical justifications of which are becoming constantly more
manifest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the desirability of a limitation of the size of the
family must not of course blind us to the fact that a very small family,
especially one where there is an only child, will often have certain
difficulties of its own, from which larger families may be relatively free.
There can be very little doubt that, in the case of the only child, the
emancipation of the individual from the family influences may frequently
present more than the usual amount of difficulty: where this is so, the
tendencies towards emancipation will need a correspondingly greater
amount of assistance and encouragement.</p></div>

almost needless to say, in most cases more liable to beset the mother
(with her more intensive preoccupation with the children in their early
years) than the father (who is usually less intimately and continuously in
contact with them).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_270_270" id="Footnote_270_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_270_270"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> As regards the actual steps which should be taken to secure this
gradual emancipation of the growing individual from the influence and
control of his family and parents, it is perhaps superfluous (and in any
case inappropriate in a book of this scope) to enter fully into details here. It
will be sufficient to indicate a few very obvious directions in which the
general principles here referred to may find application. Thus, it is clear
that children should from early years have opportunity of acquiring
experience in the use of money, having at first small sums at their
disposal, with larger amounts as they advance in age. They should also have
experience&mdash;at first perhaps occasionally and then regularly&mdash;in purchasing
their own clothes, books, writing materials and other personal requirements.
The ability to travel alone, to find one's way in strange places and to mix with
unknown people is also one that should be acquired early, leading, as it
tends to do, to the development of resourcefulness in dealing with new
situations and with varieties of human character. In view of modern
educational movements, it is perhaps hardly necessary to point out in this
connection the desirability of considerable (and eventually of complete)
freedom in the choice of studies, of occupations and of career. The need
for toleration in religious and political matters is also nowadays one that
is becoming recognised.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is perhaps necessary to emphasise the
advantages to be derived from the formation, by each individual member
of the family, of his own friendships and companionships as distinct
from those which are, so to speak, found for him by his family. Thus, it
is far from desirable that members of the same family should always
accompany one another to social gatherings, places of entertainment or
instruction, or on visits to friends. On the contrary, they will often benefit
by being freed from each other's society on these occasions, and no
restraints should, as a rule, be placed upon habits of independent
occupation or enjoyment or upon choice of associates. Nor should the
individual members of the family be expected on every occasion to render
a detailed account of all their activities outside the family circle, nor to
confine these activities rigorously to certain days or hours. Much family
friction can often be avoided by the simple process of bestowing a
latchkey! As regards extreme cases, moreover, it should be realised that
wherever there is unusual difficulty in the relations between an individual
and the other members of his family, a removal from the family
environment is the surest, perhaps the only, method of avoiding disaster.</p>

<p>Above all it is necessary, throughout the process of development
and education, to aim at the attainment of a due measure of self-respect
and self-reliance, avoiding the pitfalls of too great self-satisfaction on the
one hand and an unreasonable sense of inferiority on the other. It is here,
more than elsewhere, that considerable differentiation in the treatment of
individuals is required. Those who are inclined to be too well pleased
with themselves will usually benefit by a somewhat rougher treatment,
and will need to have their deficiencies brought home to them. Those who
lack self-confidence, or who have an unduly low estimate of their
attainments or capacities, will need encouragement and reassurance. In
the former case some very appreciable degree of parental authority may
be called for, in the latter any treatment savouring of harshness is for the
most part tragically out of place.</p></div></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
